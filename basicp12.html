              <h3>CHAPTER TEN</h3>
            </div>
            <p align="center"><strong>SOME HUMOROUS ERRORS</strong></p>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shorthand publications, 
              the reports of the proceedings of the various reporters&#8217; associations, 
              and even magazines and newspapers of general circulation, contain 
              numerous examples of the absurd mistakes made by. stenographers 
              in transcribing. In nearly every case the mistakes were due to the 
              omission of vowels, to the inability to distinguish between light 
              and heavy characters, or between large and small hooks; sometimes 
              to a combination of two or more of these. By far the most prolific 
              cause of misreadings is the omission of vowels.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the mistakes quoted in these 
              stories are ludicrous, and it is the custom to attribute them to 
              a lack of intelligence on the part of the stenographer. This is 
              not fair, as most of the mistakes are due to structural defects 
              in the system they use. It is impossible to endow a young stenographer 
              with the knowledge of language and the maturity of judgment, which 
              will enable her to tell which word out of a possible five, ten, 
              or even twenty words, represented by the same consonantal skeleton, 
              will best fit into the context.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to give some extracts from 
              articles on the subject, which I think will be of interest&#8212;and 
              a source of amusement. An article appeared in the Success magazine 
              some years ago under the title, &#8220;Some Stenographic Slips,&#8221; 
              which contained some delightful illustrations of the kind of mistakes 
              that are made on account of the lack of vowels in the outline:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain man in New 
                York City gains his living by his pen, in sense, but not in fact; 
                for, while he is a writer for periodicals, he does not write.&nbsp; 
                He uses a typewriter in duality of being, a girl and a machine.&nbsp; 
                Some years of experience with the combination has resulted in 
                his acquiring the following:<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;A sprinkle of hodden gray 
                in an otherwise russet head of hair.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;An active current account 
                in the pardonable department of the profanity section of the Recording 
                Angel&#8217;s Bureau.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;An unwholesome joy in &#8220;English 
                as she is born of stenographic notes.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;A peculiar regard for the 
                young woman who advertises that she is &#8220;rapid, accurate, 
                and educated,&#8221; in a typewriting sense.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier stages of his experience 
                he was amazed, indignant, irritated, and exasperated, by turns, 
                but in time he learned to accept the inevitable. Then began he 
                to keep a book, in which were recorded a few, a very few, of the 
                mistakes of his amanuenses. He became a philosopher, in order 
                to seek the cause of the effect. He found this course to be of 
                a double-headed sort, thus: (a) the basic defect of all systems 
                of stenography, and (b) the superficial education of the average 
                &#8220;graduate&#8221; of public or high schools linked to the 
                carelessness and ignorance that such an education breeds.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the first, you are probably 
                aware that a stenographer, when &#8220;taking&#8221; dictation, 
                practically dispenses with the signs that stand for vowels, using 
                consonant signs only, thus getting a sort of skeleton outline 
                of the word.&nbsp; This is, as stated, a defect indeed.&nbsp; 
                The context, together with the position in which the word itself 
                is written in relation to the ruled lines in the notebook is supposed 
                to enable one to supply the missing vowels or make sense of the 
                word. Thus, in the word &#8220;success,&#8221; the stenographer 
                would use the consonantal outline, &#8220;S&#8212;K&#8212;S,&#8221; 
                writing, as she does, phonetically, or by sound. Now, if the sentence 
                you dictated to her ran, &#8220;The circulation of that popular 
                magazine &#8216;S&#8212;K&#8212;S,&#8217; is increasing rapidly,&#8221; 
                the identity of the needed vowels would be apparently obvious, 
                thanks to the context&#8212;that is, obvious to a stenographer 
                of an intelligent sort. But, as &#8220;S&#8212;K&#8212;S&#8221; 
                is also the consonantal outline for <em>sikhs</em>, <em>socks</em>, 
                <em>seeks</em>, <em>sucks</em>, <em>skies</em>, and so forth, 
                you are very likely to read that &#8220;that popular magazine 
                &#8216;Socks,&#8217; is increasing, etc.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for the extracts from the book, 
                and let it be said that they are given precisely as they came 
                to the man, hot from the typewriter roller. There has been no 
                pruning, adorning, or marring.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The far-off summons of the 
                matin bell,&#8221; was butchered thus: &#8220;The far of Simmons 
                of the mutton bill.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The doctor looked grave as 
                the sick child stirred uneasily on her crib,&#8221; was rendered, 
                &#8220;The dear looked grief as the sick child stared uneasily 
                at the crab.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The beating that Ericsson 
                had given Karl was wasted on the latter,&#8221; was ingeniously 
                mutilated thus: &#8220;The batting that Ericsson had given Karl 
                was waist on the latter.&#8221; Karl was evidently bent on playing 
                Falstaff.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the apparent sense of 
                the mis-sense of the thing is charming. For instance doesn&#8217;t 
                &#8220;The litter that was the outcome of the pen, etc.,&#8221; 
                suggest the old farmyard with a bunch of squealing piglets escaping 
                from their ordained quarters? Yet the man, when he dictated, &#8220;The 
                letter was the outcome of the pen of, etc.,&#8221; had no thought 
                of pork within him. Or, again, &#8220;His career was to be thenceforward 
                as the path of an arrow in the direction of popular reform,&#8221; 
                was made to read, &#8220;His career was to be thenceforward as 
                the pith of marrow in the duration of popular reform.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one girl&#8217;s partial 
                record for one day. She left on the next, by the way. &#8220;Canterbury 
                bells,&#8221; was metamorphosed into &#8220;Canterbury balls,&#8221; 
                a most unusual print. &#8220;I will add up your account,&#8221; 
                came out, &#8220;I will do up your account,&#8221; which was enough 
                to alarm any honest debtor.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The deed shocked the nation 
                to the heart-core,&#8221; was what was said, and the typewriter 
                evolved, &#8220;The dead shocked the notion to the hard car.&#8221; 
                &#8220;The site of the mansion&#8221; was the intention, and, 
                &#8220;The sight of the mason,&#8221; the result. &#8220;Bills 
                of lading&#8221; were hardly recognizable as &#8220;balls of loading.&#8221; 
                &#8220;His heart was warmed by the glee,&#8221; was rendered, 
                &#8220;His heart was wormed by the glow.&#8221; &#8220;The rumor 
                was transient, though,&#8221; was hardly recognizable as &#8220;The 
                rammer was trains end through.&#8221; A rear-end collision was 
                evidently in that girl&#8217;s mind.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;As manna fed the Jews,&#8221; 
                was ingeniously tortured by another young woman into, &#8220;As 
                mamma fed the jays.&#8221; Yet she was a Sunday-school teacher.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When &#8220;The Battle of Waterloo,&#8221; 
                after going through the ordeal of the note-book and the machine, 
                came out as &#8220;The bottle of water l&#8217;eau,&#8221; the 
                man, astonished, determined on tracing the mental process by which 
                the stenographer had &#8220;arrived.&#8221; This is how she explained 
                herself: &#8220;Well, the outline of &#8216; battle&#8217; and 
                &#8216;bottle&#8217;is the same, you know, and I just made it 
                out &#8216;bottle&#8217;; and, of course, when I saw water after 
                that, I was sure that bottle was right&#8212;water and bottle, 
                you know&#8212; and then I came to the &#8216;l&#8217; sign that 
                was after the watet&#8217;, and I knew that there was a vowel 
                there and I couldn&#8217;t make it out until I remembered that 
                &#8216;l&#8217; with &#8216;eau&#8217; after it is French for 
                water, and you know I learned French at High school, and so, as 
                water was the word before, I thought for sure that you meant &#8216;l&#8217; 
                with the &#8216;oo&#8217; for &#8216;l&#8217;eau,&#8217; the French 
                for water, and so I just wrote it that way.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;But,&#8221; said the man, 
                &#8220;the sentence reads, &#8216;The nearest historic parallel 
                is to be found in the situation that immediately preceded the 
                battle of Waterloo.&#8217; Now in view of that sentence, oughtn&#8217;t 
                your common sense to have told you that I couldn&#8217;t possibly 
                have said &#8216;bottle of water l&#8217;eau?&#8217;&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I s&#8217;pose so,&#8221; 
                replied the high-school graduate, who had studied French, and 
                that was all she could offer in the way of explanation or defense.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Kine, knee-deep in fragrant 
                clover,&#8221; was cryptically rendered, &#8220;Keen no dip in 
                frogrent clever.&#8221; The perpetrator was on the eve of entering 
                one of the most famous women&#8217;s colleges in order to &#8220;complete 
                her education.&#8221; She attempted to condone the &#8220;keen, 
                etc.,&#8221; by explaining that she did not intend to become a 
                professional stenographer, anyway.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Plays, creeps, and laughs, 
                the innocent,&#8221; crooned the man, one day, mouthing the opening 
                lines of some projected baby verses. When the typewriter tapped 
                out, &#8220; Plays craps, and leaves the innocent,&#8221; he scanned 
                her visage closely.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, &#8220;The voice of Dr. 
                Jocelyn was heard calling for assistance,&#8221; and it came out, 
                &#8220;The vice of Dr. Josh Lane was hard killing four assistants.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dictated it was, &#8220;The hollow 
                droning of the mill wheel.&#8221; As typewritten it was, &#8220;The 
                hollow draining of the mile whale,&#8221; which is a fairly big 
                contrast, by the way.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When &#8220;But she held Jake too 
                dearly for that, and so &#8212;passed on,&#8221; was dictated, 
                and it came out, &#8220;But she held Jacks, two, drawing for that 
                and so passed, one,&#8221; would it have been unjust to credit 
                the girl at the machine with an elementary knowledge of gambling?<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Dennis, let him have the 
                pass at cut rates,&#8221; was transformed into, &#8220;Dennis, 
                let him have the pass at cat rates.&#8221; When the man asked 
                her just what she meant by it, she frankly answered that she didn&#8217;t 
                know.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the stenographer adds 
                a word to the language that is strikingly reminiscent of &#8220;Alice 
                in Wonderland&#8221;&#8212;thus: &#8220;A mess of brains spread 
                like brown lace-work over the Klep-slap.&#8221; That it should 
                have been, &#8220;A mass of briars spread like brown lace over 
                the cliff-slope,&#8221; is neither here nor there. A girl who 
                could evoke &#8220;Klepslap&#8221; is capable of great things. 
                The man told her so when he discharged her, feeling, as he did 
                so, that the universal-language people needed her badly.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of international alliances 
                must have been humming in the ears of the girl above the keys 
                when she caused &#8220;On account of this, Ethel&#8217;s life 
                was marred for all time,&#8221; to appear, &#8220;On a Count of 
                those, Ethel&#8217;s love was married for ill times.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally a new beast or bird 
                is discovered by the typewriter, thus: &#8220;The sea-quail was, 
                etc.,&#8221; the intention being, &#8220;The sequel was, etc.&#8221; 
                This was in line with a blunder made by the same girl, who avowed 
                that a &#8220;gull sunk the schooner,&#8221; instead of &#8220;a 
                gale.&#8221; On another occasion she declared that a pair of lovers 
                &#8220;hatched up a pretty squirrel,&#8221; instead of their having 
                &#8220;patched up a petty quarrel.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having confessed that once upon 
                a time she had been a waitress in a popular restaurant, the reason 
                is clear why &#8220;Foist the males of the dynasty&#8221; was 
                clicked out, &#8220;First, the meals of the dinnersty.&#8221; 
                This sounds like a &#8220;made-up,&#8221; but it is a fearful 
                fact.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The President was heard with 
                acclaim,&#8221; dictated the man. &#8220;The present was hard 
                with clam,&#8221; was what the typewriter insisted he had said, 
                as she tearfully hunted for her notes.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some stenographic systems an 
                arbitrary sign may stand for one, two, or even three words.&nbsp; 
                Sometimes, the mistranslation of one of these signs leads to funny 
                results.&nbsp; For instance, it was toward the end of a love story, 
                and the girl was expressing herself as tired of her narrow round 
                of duties and wanting an opportunity in life.&nbsp; To this the 
                so-far-undeclared youth ought to have replied according to the 
                dictation of the man, &#8220;Alice, let me be your opportunity!&#8221; 
                But the grammalogues for &#8220;particular&#8221; and opportunity 
                &#8216;were the same in the system used by the man&#8217;s stenographer, 
                and so she made Edwin plead, &#8220;Alice, let me be your particular.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the droll typewritten 
                truth of the assertion that &#8220;He is the sawed-off man that 
                one instinctively books down upon,&#8221; the departure from the 
                original, which was, &#8220;He is the sort of man one instinctively 
                hooks down upon,&#8221; was forgiven.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a political campaign the man dictated, 
                &#8220;The chattering policy of the party is of an amazing sort.&nbsp; 
                Irresponsible talk seems to have taken the place of concerted 
                action, so far as the leaders are concerned.&#8221;&nbsp; But, 
                according to the typewriter, he had declared, &#8220;The chattering 
                Pollies of the party is of an amazing sort.&nbsp; Irresponsible 
                tick seems to have taken the place of concerted coin, as far as 
                the leaders are concerned.&#8221;&nbsp; He had to admit that his 
                employee had unknowingly written much truth.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bright-haired, bonnie-faced girl, 
                with a whole stack of diplomas and references, held a position 
                with the man for one day. Seventy times and seven, more or less, 
                did he forgive her blunders during that day; but when, toward 
                evening, he spake, &#8220;Fate creeps slowly along Time&#8217;s 
                corridorsj&#8221; and she made it appear, &#8220;Feet creep slyly 
                along Tom&#8217;s car-doors,&#8221; it was too much.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another instance it was announced 
                in reference to some of the stars of a metropolitan dog show, 
                that &#8220;The Italian greyhound is a dog of high degree.&#8221; 
                The man read that he had avowed that &#8220;The Italian greyhound 
                is a Dago of high dagger.&#8221; This, by the way, was an illustrative 
                instance of the manner in which the indifferent stenographer blunders 
                to a conclusion. Thus, &#8220;d&#8212;g&#8221; is the consonantal 
                outline for dog, dago, and several other words. &#8220;D&#8212;gr&#8221; 
                is the outline of degree, dagger, and lots of other things. Now, 
                a moment&#8217;s reflection in connection with the context would 
                have given the clue to the words that the outlines represented. 
                But she had been impressed with the word &#8220;Italian&#8221; 
                in the sentence. Now, &#8220;dago&#8221; being, in the vernacular, 
                an Italian, &#8220;d&#8212;g&#8221; was surely dago, and, as all 
                dagos are supposed to carry daggers, why, &#8220;d&#8212;gr&#8221; 
                was, of course, &#8220;dagger,&#8221; and there you are.</p>

            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a paper read before 
              the New York State Stenographers&#8217; Association in 1912, Mr. 
              J. D. Strachan (a Pitmanic writer) quoted some amusing blunders 
              that have occurred in the transcripts of stenographers and reporters 
              on both sides of the Atlantic. Here are some of them:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An official note taker 
                in the law courts of England said that he dictated to one of his 
                assistants in the course of a speech these words: &#8220;Nature 
                is not so kind,&#8221; and the amanuensis turned in the transcript 
                with the passage thus: &#8220;Common sand is gone.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a case a witness said: &#8220;The 
                pursuer came to my house and spoke to me on a Tuesday,&#8221; 
                which was reproduced, &#8220;The pursuer came to my house and 
                spoke to me on the outside.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person was described by a witness 
                as &#8216;&#8216;running up very heated.&#8221; This appeared 
                in the notes as &#8220;bareheaded.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman of a well-known railway 
                happened to use the phrase, &#8220;attacking the traffic of other 
                companies,&#8221; which was rendered, &#8220;taking away the traffic 
                of other companies.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Beaconsfield said upon one 
                occasion, &#8220;Where his ashes repose.&#8221; &#8220;Where his 
                issue lives,&#8221; transcribed the phonographic but unmemoried 
                reporter. &#8220;Your application is based on two grounds,&#8221; 
                was transcribed &#8220;bad grounds.&#8221;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dictating to a stenographer a 
              synopsis of a case lawyer said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Plaintiff was the owner 
                of a mill dam which supplies water with which to run a sawmill. 
                The defendant, a competing sawmill owner, had threatened to cut 
                the water from plaintiff&#8217;s mill dam and thus prevent him 
                from sawing logs with which to fill a certain order. Held, that 
                an injunction would lie.&#8221;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way it was transcribed:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Plaintiff was 
                the owner of a mule team which supplies power with which to run 
                a sawmill. The defendant, a competing sawmill owner, had threatened 
                to cut the halters from plaintiff&#8217;s mule team and thus prevent 
                him from sawing logs with which to fill a certain order. Held, 
                that an injunction would lie.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stenographer explained that 
                the word signs for mill dam and mule team were similar, and, having 
                injected the mule team into the case, she was unable to understand 
                how cutting the water off from the mule team would interfere with 
                the running of the mules, so she concluded that instead of cutting 
                the water, it should be cutting the halters.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dictating a brief a lawyer referred 
                to &#8220;an anecdote.&#8221; The stenographer translated it into 
                &#8220;a nannygoat,&#8221; perhaps improving and certainly enlivening 
                the text.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Texas the order of the probate 
                court appointing an administrator (or administratrix, as the case 
                may be) usually reads: &#8220;It is ordered that upon the applicant, 
                John Doe, giving bond and taking the oath prescribed by law, that 
                betters testamentary or of administration issue,&#8221; etc.&nbsp; 
                A very dignified, but somewhat bashful lawyer, who was a somewhat 
                elderly bachelor, had for a client a wealthy and recently bereaved 
                widow.&nbsp; He also had an inexperienced stenographer.&nbsp; 
                The order of the court appointing his client administratrix of 
                her husband&#8217;s estate had been dictated and was lying on 
                the lawyer&#8217;s desk, he not having had time to look it over.&nbsp; 
                The client entered, and, seeing that the paper concerned her business, 
                picked it up and glanced over it.&nbsp; The attorney, who had 
                been occupied with some papers, turned to her just in time to 
                see her hastily lay the paper down, while an unmistakable blush 
                suffused her face, and she regarded him with a look of mingled 
                confusion and indignation.&nbsp; Completely mystified, he picked 
                up the offending instrument and to his horror read that: &#8220;It 
                is ordered by the court that upon the applicant, Mrs. Blank, giving 
                bond and taking a bath prescribed by law, letters of administration 
                shall issue.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lawyer dictated a notice, in a 
                separate maintenance case, that he would move the court for a 
                rule on defendant to pay the plaintiff &#8220;temporary alimony 
                and suit money.&#8221;&nbsp; As the notice came from the machine 
                it read, &#8220;Temporary alimony and soup money.&#8221;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In the <em>Stenographer</em>, Mr. P. J. Sweeney gave the following:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Our pumps are 
                recommended as being absolutely useless (noiseless).&#8221;<br />

            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago Mr. E. A. 
              Cope gave an interesting account of the errors made in transcribing 
              which have come under his notice as shorthand examiner for the Society 
              of Arts:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper names are troublesome 
                to beginners. Thompson has been rendered Adamson, Gauntlet transcribed 
                Connolly, Globe transformed to Club, and a letter dictated to 
                Mr. Warner, addressed by the dictatee to Mr. Marshall.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In examining papers, one is sometimes 
                struck by the circumstance that several candidates stumble over 
                the same word, but stumble in different directions. Three transcripts 
                handed in at a speed examination were found to contain three different 
                blunders over the simple word &#8220;pledges.&#8221; The phrase 
                dictated was, &#8220;One of the pledges.&#8221; It was variously 
                transcribed, &#8220;One of the subjects,&#8221; &#8220;One of 
                the speeches,&#8221; &#8220;One of the privileges.&#8221; The 
                word &#8220;tapped&#8221; was similarly favored with three different 
                renderings, all of them wrong. One competitor made it &#8220;tacked,&#8221; 
                another &#8220;talked,&#8221; and a third &#8220;attacked.&#8221; 
                Two scribes misread the word &#8220;promoted.&#8221; One made 
                it &#8220;prompted&#8221; and the other turned it into &#8220;permitted.&#8221; 
                The word &#8220;events&#8221; was fatal to two more. One transcribed 
                it &#8220;visions,&#8221; and the other made &#8220;evidence&#8221; 
                of it.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are a few specimens taken at 
                random from faulty transcripts: Salutation was transcribed salvation; 
                issue, as Ireland; ideas, as eye-sights; condemns, as admits; 
                minutes, as months; affection, as conviction; sober, as spirit; 
                shorter, as surer; praising, as personal; solution, as consolation; 
                dissolve as &#8220;do something&#8221;; animated as vaunted; tended, 
                as contended; played, as completed; right, as ready; amount, as 
                account; settlement, as statement; approach, as preach; notion, 
                as information; employed, as liable.<br />
                Hasty writing and imperfection of form are responsible for the 
                conversion of &#8220;they were equal to&#8221; into &#8220;they 
                would stock to&#8221;; &#8220;see nothing for them except extinction&#8221; 
                got twisted into &#8220;I say nothing, for they expect extinction.&#8220; 
                The phrase &#8220;back him up&#8221; looked libelous in its transcribed 
                form, &#8220;take me up.&#8221; And the competitor who took down 
                &#8220;I appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober&#8221; must 
                have been in some confusion as to Greek an~ Hebrew history, when 
                he wrote deliberately &#8220;appeal from Peter drunk to Peter 
                sober.&#8221;</p>

            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a paper on &#8220;Shorthand and 
              English,&#8221; read before the Incorporated Phonographic Society, 
              London, Mr. J. E. McLachlan quoted many errors in the transcription 
              of a simple passage which was dictated at an examination of shorthand 
              teachers:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Permits and even promotes&#8221; 
                was transcribed &#8220;permits and even permits.&#8221; &#8220;The 
                means of production,&#8221; an expression that had been familiar 
                through all the years since the time of Mill, was frequently transcribed 
                &#8220;mines of production.&#8221; &#8220;Excess in the hands 
                of a small class&#8221; was transcribed in one instance &#8220;chaos 
                in the hands,&#8221; etc., and in another &#8220;access,&#8221; 
                etc. &#8220;Positive privation&#8221; was variously transcribed&#8212;once 
                as &#8220;paucity of provision&#8221;; &#8220;privation&#8221; 
                appeared also as &#8220;profession.&#8221; &#8220;Breeding&#8221; 
                in the expression, &#8220;the breeding of degenerate hordes&#8221; 
                was transcribed &#8220;brooding&#8221; and &#8220;breading.&#8221; 
                &#8220;Feudalism&#8221; was transcribed as &#8220;fatalism.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report says that Mr. McLachlan 
                &#8220;reminded his hearers that the candidates were not students, 
                but candidates for the teachers&#8217; diploma&#8221; and that 
                the test was the easiest one set.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This is taken from an address by Mr. J. N. Kimball to a class of 
              shorthand teachers:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I dictate something 
                about the &#8220;tales of the monks of ye olden time,&#8221; I 
                don&#8217;t like to find that I am mistaken and that it was monkeys 
                which had the tails, not the monks, just because the outlines 
                are alike.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I write to some bereaved 
                friends and say things which I trust will &#8220;soften the force 
                of the blow,&#8221; I mildly expostulate when I find myself telling 
                them that &#8220;time will soften the fires of the below.&#8221; 
                And if I have occasion to rise in my wrath and tell some chap 
                that he is &#8220;no account,&#8221; it hurts my pride to find 
                that I have only intimated that he is &#8220;knock-kneed.&#8221;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some 
              of my readers have not studied other systems, it may be well to 
              describe the method by which vowels are expressed in disjoined-vowel 
              systems, when they are expressed at all.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, twelve 
              vowels are expressed by a dot and a dash in three positions alongside 
              the consonant. The dot is made heavy for certain vowels and the 
              dash is likewise made heavy for certain vowels. In theory, at least, 
              these fine distinctions are supposed to be observed in writing and 
              to be observable in reading.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A Scientific Analysis. &#8212;</strong> 
              The best scientific demonstration we have read of the absurdity 
              and impracticability of this method of vowel representation was 
              that made by Mr. Edward Anderson in the <em>Journalist</em> (London) 
              for December 15, 1888, in answer to an attack on the Taylor system, 
              which had appeared in the <em>Phonetic Journal</em>. It gives us 
              pleasure to quote Mr. Anderson&#8217;s analysis of the manner in 
              which vowels are expressed, when they <em>are</em> expressed, in 
              Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider 
              for a moment what vowel-position really means in practice. The normal 
              length of a consonant may be taken as &#x215b; of an inch. Therefore 
              in a system of three-placed vowels the dot or tick must be written 
              accurately to the 42/1000 part of an inch. If a system admits half-length 
              consonants (as Phonography does) then the vowel to the half-lengths 
              must be written accurately to the 21/1000 part of an inch. Moreover 
              these extremely fine distinctions have to be adhered to when the 
              hand is writing at the rate of say 150 words a minute equal to 2&frac12; 
              words in every second of time. Is the thing practicable? Taylor 
              says it is not. You almost agree with him, for you go on to say 
              that Byrom&#8217;s five positions are clearly too many; and these 
              are equivalent to a distinction of the 25/1000 part of an inch, 
              which gives a trifle greater scope than the Phonographic half-lengths. 
              Besides, since the time of Taylor, the refinements of light dots 
              and heavy dots, light dashes and heavy dashes have been invented, 
              which render accuracy still more impracticable. In addition to all 
              this we have the very weighty evidence of experts in Phonography, 
              who tell us that it is not necessary or practicable to insert more 
              than one vowel in every 30 or 40 words.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What 
              &#8220;Position&#8221; Fails to Do. &#8212;</strong> As it is utterly 
              impracticable to express many vowels by disjoined dots and dashes&#8212;made 
              light and heavy and placed in certain positions alongside the consonants&#8212;after 
              the completion of the consonantal skeleton of the word, resort is 
              had to position to indicate the vowels. As we have shown in another 
              chapter, this simply means that the <em>sixteen</em> sounds (twelve 
              vowels and four diphthongs) are supposed to be indicated by three 
              positions, an average of more than five for each position. And the 
              position does not tell <em>where</em> the vowel occurs in the word!<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That accomplished shorthand reporter, 
              Mr. George R. Bishop, in discussing the weakness of Pitman&#8217;s 
              Phonography in vowel expression, put the case very well. He said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
                the <em>vowel</em> department, there has been what seemed to be 
                a grim despair as to finding any solution of the undoubtedly serious 
                difficulty&#8212;the case seeming hopeless, and an equally grim 
                determination to disguise the existence of the defect. The mode 
                of <em>indicating</em> vowels by &#8220;position&#8221; of the 
                consonant signs was a device of the older shorthand systems long 
                antedating Mr. Pitman. As Mr. Pitman adopted some consonant signs 
                and devices from older systems, so he seems also to have adopted 
                from them this ancient <em>vowel indication</em> idea.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was this marked difference, 
                however&#8212;a difference which told heavily against him on the 
                score of definiteness: that while the older systems indicated 
                at most, six vowels by three positions, or two for each position, 
                the Pitman undertook to indicate, with the same number of &#8220;positions&#8221; 
                from fifteen to twenty sounds, including the diphthongs; and while 
                some of the old systems indicated their smaller number of vowels 
                merely as <em>initial</em> ones&#8212;those <em>preceding</em> 
                the strokes so written in &#8220;position&#8221;&#8212;the Pitman 
                undertook to indicate its larger number of <em>sounds</em> not 
                only as preceding, <em>but also as following</em>, the consonants 
                written; thus doubling the already increased ambiguity. . . . 
                It is needless to comment on the heavy task imposed on the shorthand 
                writer who is obliged to guess <em>which one</em> of twelve different 
                things indicated by the same position is the one actually intended 
                in a particular instance.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet many 
              advocates of this clumsy, indefinite method of &#8220;indicating&#8221; 
              five or more vowels by one &#8220;position&#8221; (which cannot 
              be observed with precision in rapid writing) and in a manner which 
              does not tell whether the vowel precedes or follows the consonant 
              or, indeed, where it occurs in the word, will hold up their hands 
              in absolute horror at the thought of three closely-related vowel 
              sounds being expressed in practical writing by one sign! Could insincerity 
              or prejudice&#8212; call it what you will &#8212; go farther than 
              this?<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now going to give a number of 
              quotations from eminent authors, reporters, and teachers on the 
              importance of the vowels. The first quotation is from Mr. George 
              R. Bishop. a distinguished reporter. and the author of &#8220;Exact 
              Phonography.&#8221; Mr. Bishop has been President of the New York 
              State Stenographers&#8217; Association and President of the Law 
              Stenographers&#8217; Association of the City of New York. His views 
              on joined vowels are set forth in considerable detail in the preface 
              to &#8220;Exact Phonography,&#8221; which was a very ingenious effort 
              to incorporate joined vowels by strokes in a geometric system.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning 
                to the standard textbooks of Phonography and looking for a practical 
                illustration of this indefiniteness, one found that its author 
                repeatedly recognized it as among the possibilities that a writer 
                of this system would employ the same outline in the same position, 
                with equal cogency, to represent any one of eight or nine different 
                words: often necessitating, one would conclude, nearly as profound 
                a study of contexts and the general drift and meaning of the matter 
                reported as an archaeologist would need to employ in the deciphering 
                of a partly defaced ancient tablet.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one result of dissatisfaction 
                at this indefiniteness, the last decade has witnessed the appearance 
                of a considerable number of new works on shorthand; a distinct 
                effort to remedy this one more serious defect being discernible 
                as a leading motive in most of them. In England this striving 
                after something better has been particularly noteworthy.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <em>Reporter&#8217;s Assistant</em> 
                (Second Edition) we find &#8220;opened, pound, pent, append, compend, 
                pained, paint, pinned, compound, penned, punned, oppugned,&#8221; 
                as different readings for the same sign in the same position. 
                Obviously it might be difficult for even the most expert and best-informed 
                writer to determine from the context which of these twelve words, 
                eleven of which could be employed as verbs, was just the one to 
                be transcribed, in a particular connection. Leaving the expert 
                writer, and coming to one not highly skilled&#8212;one unable 
                to appreciate what best fitted the context&#8212;what would his 
                situation be, assuming that he sought aid from the Reporter&#8217;s 
                Assistant? And what should we expect the mental state of a class 
                of boys of thirteen or fourteen to be, if, on being first assembled 
                as a class in phonography, it were described to them how much 
                of indefiniteness there was inherent in the vowel part of the 
                system&#8212;the &#8220;Assistant&#8221; being referred to as 
                indicating one of the possible results of it? What matter of surprise 
                is it that so little progress has been made in the teaching of 
                shorthand in schools, in view of this inexact state of the art?</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac 
              Dement&#8217;s Emphatic Statement. &#8212; In the preface to his 
              textbook on Pitmanic Shorthand (Second Edition) Mr. Isaac Dement 
              said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have 
                seen the time when I would have given the price of the transcript 
                for a single vowel. . . . Some of the best reporters of my acquaintance 
                employ vowels very freely&#8212; if they cannot put them in at 
                the time, the first lull finds them busy ornamenting their notes 
                with them&#8212;and the poorest reporters (?) I know say they 
                have no need of vowels, in fact, never learned them.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an 
              article on &#8220;Significant Tendencies in Shorthand,&#8221; Mr.

                has been my experience, and it is that of many old reporters with 
                whom I have talked, that the fatal weakness of the Pitmanic systems 
                lies in the general inability to determine how a word begins, 
                whether with a consonant or a vowel, and if a vowel, what one.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A 
              Famous London Reporter.</strong> &#8212; The next quotation is worthy 
              of a careful reading. It is from the pen of Mr. Thomas Hill, Past 
              President of the Shorthand Society, London, head of the firm of 
              Thomas Hill &amp; Co., Law Reporters, London. Mr. Hill has been 
              a writer and reporter, using the Pitman system for over thirty-five 
              years.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
                to the mode in which the vowels should be represented, probably 
                most experts would agree that joinable vowel signs, which could 
                be written in the order of their occurrence, and woven, so to 
                speak, into the texture of the word, would be preferable to the 
                detached marks sprinkled in among the consonants, out of their 
                natural sequence, after the consonantal skeleton has been placed 
                upon the page. In any system the provision of a complete set of 
                easily joinable vowels would do as much to compensate for shortcomings 
                which might exist in other parts of the stenographic scheme.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional phonographers have, 
                no doubt, often wished, when dealing with unusual words or difficult 
                subject matter, that their system provided them with joined vowels, 
                or, at least, with vowels of such shape that they could be joined 
                initially.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vowel occurring initially is generally 
                the most distinctive vowel in the word, and for joining purposes 
                it is probably the most important. In some cases it is the only 
                vowel which it is necessary to insert for the purpose of making 
                a distinction between two words containing the same consonants. 
                It may often lead to the recognition of a distorted outline, and 
                so give a clue to the whole word. The insertion of an initial 
                vowel would have prevented an equilateral triangle from being 
                rendered as a collateral triangle in a sermon published in a once 
                well-known serial. Apart from the characters for <em>w</em> and 
                <em>y</em>, there is only one vowel in Phonography, namely, the 
                long <em>i</em>, which will lend itself to junction with an outline, 
                and the possibility of joining even that one is restricted to 
                three or four consonants.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An incidental benefit arising from 
                the use of joined vowels is that it enables the first syllable 
                or two of a long word to be used in many cases with safety to 
                represent the whole word, and puts into the hands of an experienced 
                writer a means of extemporizing contractions without the risk 
                of illegibility. The clipping of words after this manner has been 
                in use probably from the earliest days of shorthand, but a system 
                in which connective vowels are used gives the best opportunities 
                for carrying out this method of abbreviation.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Herbert 
              Spencer&#8217;s Views. &#8212;</strong> The great English scientist 
              and philosopher, Herbert Spencer, in his criticism of Pitman&#8217;s 
              Shorthand dwelt strongly upon the unscientific nature of disjoined 
              vowels. The analytical nature of his remarks on the subject show 
              that this great authority had given the subject a great deal of 
              thought. He said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
                vowels are not sufficiently distinguishable. The sounds, e, a, 
                ah, are indicated by dots, and au, o, oo, by small dashes; and 
                it is hardly to be expected that in rapid writing these marks 
                can be made with such accuracy as to insure their identification. 
                Moreover, the distinction between the individual vowels, dependent 
                as it is upon the placing of the dot or dash at the beginning, 
                middle, or end of a consonant, is such as cannot be observed with 
                certainty. And, further, the greater heaviness of touch by which 
                the long vowels are known from the short ones can never be given 
                with anything like precision without an amount of care inconsistent 
                with expedition. &#8230;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legibility of the system is 
                certainly- injured by the apparent transposition of letters, resulting 
                from the peculiar arrangement of the vowels. A dot at the beginning 
                of a consonant is, as likely as not, to signify a vowel after 
                it, or dot at the end to imply a vowel before. &#8230;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phonography looks simple in consequence 
                of these movements having no representations upon paper, whilst 
                in reality they require an equal amount of time with those that 
                leave visible signs behind them. Nay, more; to lift the point 
                of a pencil from the paper and carry it over the surface to make 
                a dot at some other place, involves a more complicated muscular 
                action than its transference to the same point along the surface 
                (that is, without leaving the paper), and probably more time is 
                expended in the motion.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial 
              difficulty which the student encounters in separating vowels and 
              consonants is well expressed by Julius Rasmussen, LL. B.:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
                the student takes up a Pitmanic system, he is taught to make outlines 
                of the consonant characters and omit all -silent letters and vowels, 
                which may give him the same outlines for such words as <em>eastern</em>, 
                <em>Saturn</em>, <em>Austrian</em>, <em>stern</em>, and <em>strain</em>. 
                Since the student has for ten or fifteen years looked upon language 
                as composed of consonant and vowel sounds, it will necessarily 
                take him several months to learn to look at the language in this 
                new way. And what is most important, while the writing is difficult 
                the reading is still more difficult, and the consequence is that 
                the transcript is very faulty.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Masterly 
              Statement of Case. &#8212;</strong> One of the most powerful presentations 
              of the arguments in favor of joined vowels was made by Mr. Hugh 
              L. Callendar, B.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, author 
              of &#8220;Cursive Shorthand&#8221;:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
                the disjoined-vowel systems the consonant outline of each word 
                is written first, and the vowels are dotted in afterwards in their 
                proper places. This is called &#8220;vocalizing&#8221; the outline. 
                The writer has to go over each word twice, in a highly artificial 
                and unnatural order, if he wants to put in the vowels, that is 
                to say, if he wishes his writing to be legible. &#8230;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often maintained that a detached 
                vowel mark counts in loss of time only about as much as an extra 
                lifting of the pen. This is very far from true. In addition to 
                the lifting of the pen there is the time occupied in making the 
                stroke or dot and locating it carefully in its proper position. 
                This is not unnaturally found to be longer than the time required 
                for the mere making of the same number of dots and ticks irrespective 
                of position. Besides this, detached vowels usually involve hesitation: 
                after finishing the consonant outline the writer has to make up 
                his mind what vowels to insert and where, or whether he can leave 
                the outline unvocalized: with unskilled writers this is a fruitful 
                source of loss of time: with skilled writers it is often almost 
                unnoticeable. But the most serious hesitation generally occurs, 
                and this even with the most skilful writers, <em>after</em> inserting 
                the vowels and before proceeding to the next words. This is most 
                strongly marked after inserting two or more vowels in one outline. 
                It is probably due to the illogical order in which the vowels 
                are written. The mind momentarily loses its place in the sentence, 
                and has to go back and pick up the lost thread, so as to find 
                what comes next. The result is that the insertion of detached 
                vowel marks always involves such a disproportionate expenditure 
                of time, that they must be omitted in writing at any reasonable 
                speed.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief advantage of detached 
                vowels is that they present an <em>appearance</em> of brevity, 
                and look neat, especially in print. They are so inconspicuous 
                that the inexperienced eye does not realize the difficulty of 
                inserting them accurately and takes no account of the aerial movements 
                of the pen which their insertion involves.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Significant 
              Confession. &#8212;</strong> Perhaps the most convincing indictment 
              of disjoined vowels is to be found in a quotation given in &#8220;Progressive 
              Studies in Phonography,&#8221; published by Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons. 
              Here it is:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just 
                where the greatest speed is necessary, to write a consonant and 
                then put in the vowels in their proper places, is where the most 
                hesitation is likely to be. First, time is lost in getting the 
                true sounds of the words; second, comes the quickly-to-be-disposed-of 
                thought how to write the consonants the best way and which vowels 
                to put in and how many (all this is less than a second). By this 
                time the outline has made such spasmodic jerks that full-lengths 
                are half-lengths and half-lengths are twice as long as they ought 
                to be, or an intended hook has been made into a circle or a circle 
                into a hook.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The 
              Dual Analysis of Words. &#8212;</strong> Another view of the matter 
              is presented by Mr. D. Kimball:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
                Phonography all the vowels are of necessity written separately 
                from the consonants, i. e., must be written beside the consonant 
                so as to show what sound they represent by the position they are 
                in. It is so difficult to put them in their exact position in 
                writing, even beside full length consonants, where the writer 
                must bring his pen down one-twelfth of an inch, and be sure a 
                dot does not lengthen into a dash, that were this the only defect 
                it would be an almost effectual bar to rapid writing. But consonants 
                are made half-length&#8212;about one-twelfth of an inch long, 
                each of which has also its three positions. We venture the assertion 
                that the person never lived who had that accurate command of his 
                hand that would enable him to write vocalized Phonography fifty 
                words a minute and get his dots and dashes the right shape, and 
                just where they belong, beside the full and half-length consonants. 
                This is never attempted in practical work; but it is a necessary 
                part of the theory, a hideous nightmare to the learner and user.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Kimball 
              then describes the &#8220;dual analysis of words necessary in Phonography&#8221;:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
                difficulty of writing sufficiently exact to be legible mentioned 
                above, is a minor one compared with that of the double analysis 
                which the writer of Phonography is compelled to go through with 
                each word when fully expressed. He is obliged first to go through 
                each word mentally, analyze it, pick out the consonants and write 
                them; then, beginning the word again, re-analyze it, pick out 
                the vowels and dot or dash them in beside the full or half-length 
                consonant, being sure he remembers their positions and lands them 
                exactly where they belong, or he will rue it when he comes to 
                read.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 
              giving some illustrations of this troublesome process, he concludes 
              with this:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
                a necessary accompaniment of this tedious, unnatural and burdensome 
                double analysis, comes the slow, uncertain and difficult process 
                of putting in the disconnected dots and dashes beside the consonants-a 
                process so irksome that most phonographic writers prefer to halt, 
                stumble, and guess in reading unvocalized outlines rather than 
                go to the extra time and trouble of putting in the vowels in so 
                awkward and unnatural a way&#8212;unnatural because the order 
                of the letters is not that of the words in which they occur&#8212;one 
                does not think that way, speak that way, or write that way, except 
                when he is trying to use this exceptional, crude, and ill-devised 
                scheme. It is too laborious, unnatural, slow, and unsatisfactory 
                for practical use even by the devotees of the system. Yet it is 
                the best they have to offer.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Advantages 
              of Joined Vowels Summarized. &#8212;</strong> One of the best presentations 
              of the case for joined vowels is to be found in a paper on &#8220;The 
              Power of Connective-Vowels in Shorthand,&#8221; which was read by 
              Mr. Peter Vogel, law reporter, before the Pennsylvania Shorthand 
              Reporter&#8217;s Association in 1904. Mr. Vogel is a writer of Lindsley&#8217;s 
              Takigrafy&#8212;a connective-vowel system on a Pitmanic basis. Here 
              are some paragraphs from this paper:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vowels 
                not dependent on position can be independently written, and so 
                furnish a broader basis for &#8220;wordsigns,&#8221; and relieve 
                the overloaded consonants, and in that proportion at least, enhance 
                legibility.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often much quicker to write 
                the vowel than to move to position and have, besides, something 
                to read instead of ending with a guess. The resulting outline 
                on paper may seem to be the longer, when in reality it is shorter. 
                So both speed and legibility are gained.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the necessary lifting of 
                the pen and replacing it on paper at &#8220;position&#8221; adds 
                immensely to this invisible &#8220;waste of material,&#8221; which 
                so deceivingly looks like brevity and speed.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eighteen vowels and diphthongs 
                are distributed to three positions, as in Phonography, say six 
                to a place, the riddle in reading is, &#8220;Which of the six 
                is meant?&#8221; And if there happens to be a series of like ambiguities 
                following or preceding, the solution may become dangerous. Some 
                years ago, for example, a Democratic and a Republican reporter 
                &#8220;took&#8221; a political speech in Phonography for their 
                respective St. Louis papers, and an important passage appeared 
                in print diametrically opposite in sense, resulting in a considerable 
                quarrel. When the matter was sifted, each reporter had the same 
                consonant outline and the difference lay in the political spectacles 
                through which the absent vowel was seen. This could not have happened 
                with a connective vowel.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the peculiar outline often 
                determined where the vowel to be guessed at should go, it sometimes 
                becomes enough of a problem to determine its imaginary habitat 
                to delay and even puzzle the reader.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of having the outline-form 
                kept to determine the place where the guess comes in, it becomes 
                necessary to commit many special forms, where the connective-vowel 
                writer can proceed with delightful abandon.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A connective vowel often relieves 
                what would otherwise be a bad angle, and here again the longer 
                form is the speedier, in addition to being definite.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of possible outlines 
                can be greatly multiplied by the use or absence of a vowel, and 
                so relieve consonant outlines from congestion and make them more 
                definite.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definiteness which a written 
                vowel gives to an abbreviation often enables one to shorten it 
                beyond what is otherwise possible, thus contributing to speed 
                and retaining legibility.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of a vowel in a particular 
                place is often in a connective-vowel system an indication of what 
                it is, from the fact that had it been another vowel it would have 
                been so easily written at that particular place that it would 
                not have been omitted.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper nouns, such as names of persons 
                and places, especially when unfamiliar, must be vocalized to be 
                legible, and where there is a succession of them, as often happens, 
                Phonographic &#8220;position&#8221; is inadequate, vocalization 
                too slow and longhand out of the question.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar thing is true in meeting 
                the expert witness. No reporter, especially no young reporter, 
                can be acquainted with all the new terms of advancing science 
                and art, and many of these terms when unvocalized are either hopelessly 
                confused or irretrievably lost.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Position-writing to express omitted 
                vowels depends on the accented vowel, is governed by it, when 
                as a matter of fact that is often far from being the important 
                vowel in the word or the most helpful either in writing or reading 
                the word.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As said before, there is quite an 
                extended and growing list of words wholly vowel, where Phonography 
                must always utterly fail.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Position writing is a hindrance 
                to freedom in phrasing and often requires a word to be read against 
                the position it occupies. Here the connective vowel is peculiarly 
                at home.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have 
              now said enough, and quoted enough in support of joined vowels. 
              The next point is: How shall the vowels be represented in a joined-vowel 
              system? As the vowels are vastly more frequent than consonants, 
              it follows logically that if vowels are to be joined, they should 
              be expressed by the most facile of all characters&#8212;circles 
              and hooks. As Mr. Kimball put it in &#8220;How Shall We Write?&#8221;:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consonants 
                are to a word what the bones are to the body&#8212;the large, 
                strong framework. Vowels are to words what the flesh is to the 
                body: they give to them form, flexibility, volume. It is desirable 
                that two classes of sound should be represented by letters readily 
                distinguishable; to the consonants should be assigned large letters, 
                and it is best that the vowels should be represented by small 
                letters.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even 
              that militant champion of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, Thomas Allen 
              Reed, in reviewing the Duploy&eacute; system, makes this admission:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
                use of the circle for certain vowels enables many short words, 
                in which some vowel representation is absolutely necessary, to 
                be easily and briefly written without lifting the pen.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
              it is remembered that the great bulk of the words the stenographer 
              will have to write are &#8220;short words&#8221; the significance 
              of this admission will be apparent.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Circle &#8220;Speeds the Writer.&#8221; 
              &#8212;</strong> In Pitman publications in England, no writer is 
              more frequently quoted at the present time than Mr. James Hynes, 
              the manager of the London office of Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons. One 
              of the Pitman publications recently contained a series of &#8220;Lecturettes 
              on Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand,&#8221; by Mr. Hynes. These lecturettes 
              were evidently written for the purpose of minimizing the numerous 
              difficulties of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand. The airy way in which 
              Mr. Hynes disposed of some of the problems that confront both learner 
              and teacher must fill the mind of anyone who is familiar with the 
              subject with something like admiration. But the difficulties remain!<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hynes did not confine himself 
              to mere exposition of rules and exceptions to rules. Here and there 
              he diverges from the main topic to defend the system of his employers. 
              Speaking of the use of the circle for <em>s</em>, for instance, 
              he says:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
                system is built for speed. &#8230; Think of the extraordinary 
                facility of form provided by the use of the small circle for <em>s</em>, 
                and how, as a matter of fact, the inclusion of the circles actually 
                speeds the writer, in the majority of cases, by reason of the 
                easy, graceful sweep with which the outline can be made as a result 
                of the introduction of the circle into the form. It is an interesting 
                and undoubted fact that the writing of the circle <em>s</em> medially, 
                though it adds another sign to the outline, in a great majority 
                of cases very materially increases the speed at which the outline 
                can be written. You only have to try such forms as <em>fsn</em>, 
                <em>msl</em>, <em>rsm</em>, <em>rslv</em>, <em>psi</em>, <em>tsk</em>, 
                <em>ksp</em>, with and without the circle, and I am sure you will 
                agree with the statement.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently 
              Mr. Hynes has been profiting from our anaiysis of the value of the 
              circle! The interesting fact is this: That our statements about 
              the circle&#8212;made again and again, in almost the identical language 
              now used by Mr. Hynes&#8212;have been vociferously denied and ridiculed 
              by the advocates of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand! It is refreshing to 
              have our theories so ably championed by an employ&eacute; of the 
              Pitman firm! If Mr. Hynes is correct in his statement about the 
              circle increasing the speed of the writing, the question is: Which 
              system has made the best use of the circle? Manifestly s does not 
              occur by any means as often as the vowels <em>e</em> and <em>a</em>, 
              hence the circle which; according to Mr. Hynes, &#8220;speeds the 
              writer,&#8221; occurs much more frequently in Gregg Shorthand than 
              in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Oliver McEwan, who was for many 
              years regarded as a high authority on Isaac Pitman Shorthand, said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now 
                all shorthand writers know that an outline composed of two straight 
                strokes connected by a circle is usually more easy, or at least 
                quite as easy, to write as a combination of the same two strokes 
                <em>without the circle</em>. The circle occupies no time in writing, 
                its formation being equal to the making of the angle at the point 
                of union of the two strokes. The Pitman outline for <em>task</em> 
                (<em>tsk</em>) is quite as easy to write as the outline for <em>take</em> 
                (<em>tk</em>).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there 
              is considerable difference in the manner in which circles and hooks 
              are used to represent vowels in various joined-vowel systems. When 
              we discuss the application of these various basic principles in 
              the construction of the alphabet of &#8220;Light-Line Phonography,&#8221; 
              we hope to demonstrate very conclusively that the plan followed 
              by the French systems and by the adaptations of these systems to 
              English, and which was copied by several indigenous systems, is 
              not the most practical one for the English language.</p>

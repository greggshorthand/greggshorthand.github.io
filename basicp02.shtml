            <div style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Confronted by 
              a new invention an American almost invariably asks: &#8220;Will 
              it work?&#8221; Until satisfied on that point, he is seldom interested 
              in the mechanical principles on which the invention is constructed. 
              But when the invention has been demonstrated to be a real advance, 
              he wants to take the motor apart to see how it works.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This will explain why so little has been written 
              about the scientific basis of Gregg Shorthand. The policy pursued 
              in presenting the claims of the system was that of concentrating 
              attention on the <em>results</em> accomplished by its students and 
              writers. Even after Gregg Shorthand had achieved the most extraordinary 
              success ever attained by any system in the history of shorthand, 
              I was too busily engaged in the production of textbooks and magazines, 
              and in the building of a publishing organization, to respond to 
              the demand for a detailed explanation of the scientific principles 
              on which the system was constructed. At odd moments, as opportunity 
              offered and as the mood dictated, I made shorthand notations for 
              a series of articles on the subject. A few of the articles were 
              published in the <em>Gregg Shorthand Magazine</em> (England) some 
              years ago, but the reduction in the size of that magazine on account 
              of war conditions rendered it necessary to discontinue the series. 
              Since then so many teachers and writers of the system, on both sides 
              of the Atlantic, have urged me to complete the series that I decided 
              to do so, and to publish them in book form.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that the articles were first written 
                for a magazine published in England will explain to American readers 
                the numerous references to Isaac Pitman Shorthand, a system which 
                is now little used in America outside of New York City and some 
                parts of Canada, and also why so many quotations from well-known 
                authors and writers of other systems are used in support of each 
                principle expounded. In giving these quotations I had in mind 
                the fact that in England there is more reverence for &#8220;precedent&#8221; 
                and &#8220;authority&#8221; than is the case in this country.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After reading this book in proof form, one 
                of the most capable supporters of our system said: &#8220;The 
                explanation of curvilinear motion as a basic principle in the 
                construction of the system was a revelation to me. What puzzles 
                me is why you made that feature so prominent in the Preface of 
                your very first edition and have practically ignored it in recent 
                editions.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The explanation I gave was that for many years 
              my problem was to &#8220;convert&#8221; teachers of other systems, 
              and in doing this I found it best to move along the lines of least 
              resistance by dealing chiefly with things that were familiar to 
              writers and teachers of the older systems. In discussing the system 
              question I began, for example, with the elimination of shading or 
              thickening. As all teachers and writers of the old-style systems 
              had experienced the difficulty of observing the distinction between 
              thick and thin characters, and knew that the thickening of a character 
              was an obstacle to rapid writing, they were willing to admit that 
              the elimination of thickened characters would be an advantage, &#8220;other 
              things being equal.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next step was to explain that the vowels 
                were written in the outline. The difficulty of inserting vowels 
                after the &#8220;consonantal skeleton&#8221; had been written, 
                and the difficulty of reading shorthand when the vowels were omitted, 
                were so obvious that most teachers were willing to admit with 
                the <em>usual</em> qualifying expression that the insertion of 
                the vowels would be an advantage.<br />
                The third step was to gain an admission that the placing of words 
                in various positions with relation to the line was an obstacle 
                to rapid writing and to phrase-writing. This generally elicited 
                the most hearty expressions of concurrence of any principle presented.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up to this point we were dealing with things 
              that were familiar to them. When I attempted to go beyond these 
              three principles, I found that Bagehot was right when he said, &#8220;One 
              of the greatest pains to humanity is the pain of a new idea. It 
              is so &#8216;upsetting' &#8212; you do not know at once which of 
              your old ideas it will or will not turn out.&#8221;<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Much experience convinced me that it was a 
                mistake in tactics to dwell very long upon the other principles 
                of the system, such as the Longhand Movement, Curvilinear Motion, 
                or Lineality, except perhaps in an incidental way. Any stress 
                placed upon features of the system that were absolutely new and 
                unfamiliar to teachers and writers of the old-style systems would 
                be so &#8220;upsetting&#8221; and confusing to them, and therefore 
                so provocative of argument, as to nullify the progress made up 
                to that point.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The objective to be gained was <em>the creation 
              of a desire to study the system</em>. To accomplish this it was 
              best to show them how the system eliminated certain specific difficulties 
              or defects in the system they used. If they did study the system, 
              the advantages obtained from the other features of the system would 
              gradually, but inevitably, become clear to them as soon as they 
              could write the system on connected matter.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In reading this, many hundreds of teachers 
                and writers of the system who formerly wrote other systems will 
                doubtless remember the various mental reactions which occurred 
                during the period of transition from the Old to the New, and will 
                smile appreciatively at this explanation of the process.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As these articles have been written at various 
                times, and sometimes under pressure, they may lack the unity of 
                plan and treatment which is desirable in a work of this kind. 
                I believe, however, that those interested in shorthand as an art 
                and a science will find them helpful in tracing the process of 
                the evolution of the art of shorthand toward principles that are 
                logical and natural to the mind and characters and movements that 
                are natural to the hand.

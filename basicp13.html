              expedient of writing words in several different positions in relation 
              to the line of writing is a very old one, and one that has been 
              used for almost every conceivable purpose. It has been used for 
              doubling letters, for indicating omissions of vowels or consonants 
              and as a means of distinction between word forms.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;Position&#8221; an 
              Old Expedient. &#8212;</strong> In a paper read before the Shorthand 
              Society, London, in 1885, Mr. Edward Pock-nell described in an interesting 
              way the various purposes for which position writing had been applied 
              in systems since the beginning of alphabetic shorthand:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already referred 
                to &#8220;position&#8221; being used for vowel-dots and &#8220;vowel-mode,&#8221; 
                and in some instances for differentiating consonant characters 
                <em>of</em> and <em>in</em> the alphabet. For the former purposes 
                it dates back to the first alphabetical system, that of John Willis 
                (1602). &#8220;Position&#8221; has been so generally used for 
                various purposes that we may take it that it has not been neglected 
                by any author, as a principle, more or less to be used as a contracting 
                method, especially for logograms and terminations. The principle 
                was adopted more or less in all the early systems. Lyle (1762) 
                used three positions (<em>above</em>, <em>on</em> and <em>below</em> 
                the line,) and the principle occurs in various systems, but it 
                is worthy of note that Mayor (1795) discarded the use of this 
                principle for words, but stated specifically that had it not been 
                for burdening the memory he would have made use of three positions 
                in reference to the line for logograms. Rid-path (1687) <em>indicated</em> 
                omitted words by position in relation to each other&#8212;viz., 
                <em>above</em> or <em>below</em>, or <em>far from</em>, or near 
                to, the preceding word. Thus he indicated the presence of &#8220;to,&#8221; 
                &#8220;of,&#8221; &#8220;with,&#8221; &#8220;by,&#8221; &#8220;from,&#8221; 
                &#8220;for,&#8221; without writing the words. Byrom used three 
                positions for his horizontal stroke <em>s</em> to get the vowel 
                before it, as in, &#8220;as,&#8221; &#8220;is,&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221;; 
                but his stickling for lineality prevented the application of &#8220;position&#8221; 
                to any but the horizontal stroke.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;Position&#8221; 
              Condemned by Isaac Pitman. &#8212;</strong> It is not generally 
              known that Isaac Pitman rejected position-writing in the first editions 
              of his system and condemned it unsparingly. Writing about some of 
              the earlier systems, he said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Systems of shorthand 
                that depend for their existence upon staves, like music, or even 
                on a single line on which the letters have a three-fold power 
                of expressing different words above, on, or below the line are 
                certainly practicable, but they are not practical.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as time went on Mr. 
              Pitman found that, on account of the omission of vowels in his system 
              in practical writing, many words containing the same consonants 
              but different vowels, were misread.&nbsp; He, therefore, reluctantly 
              introduced position-writing.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a previous chapter I quoted the 
              statement of Mr. Graham that&#8221; Mr. Pitman appropriated from 
              Harding the plan of writing words in three different positions, 
              to imply first-position, second-position, or third-position vowels. 
              See Harding&#8217;s book (1830), page 24, last paragraph but one.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That position writing has some value 
              in a disjoined vowel system for the purpose for which it is used 
              need not be disputed. It is merely a crutch to bolster up an organic 
              weakness in the structure of the system, and as a crutch it is useful, 
              although its usefulness is greatly exaggerated by some of its advocates. 
              To hear some of them talk about it one would imagine that the placing 
              of an outline in a certain position indicated precisely what the 
              omitted vowel was and where it occurred in the word. Put under the 
              acid test of facts this claim vanishes. There are in Pitman&#8217;s 
              Shorthand twelve vowels and four diphthongs; these are supposed 
              to be expressed by three positions; that is to say, about <em>five</em> 
              for each position. How much of definiteness is there in that? That 
              is not all, because position does not indicate where the vowel occurs 
              in the outline. In short, position-writing, if observed, merely 
              indicates that <em>one of five vowels</em> or <em>diphthongs</em> 
              occurs <em>somewhere</em> in the outline; it does not tell <em>what</em> 
              the vowel or diphthong is nor <em>where</em> it occurs.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Condemned by Others. &#8212;</strong> 
              Candid Pitman writers and teachers acknowledge that position-writing 
              is a much overrated expedient. In a discussion at a meeting of the 
              Manchester District of the Incorporated Society of Shorthand Teachers 
              about four years ago, Mr. Sandiford, a well-known and accomplished 
              teacher of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hallam has dwelt 
                on the point that vocalization in Pitman is now much less scientific 
                than it used to be, that it is more difficult than ever to decipher 
                a word, that more is thrown upon position writing than ever before, 
                and that <em>position-writing in itself is one of the most dangerous 
                expedients you can possibly have in any system of shorthand</em>.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my conclusion, too. It is, 
                it seems to me, a mistake on the part of Pitmanites to labor the 
                question of the positional representation of vowels. After all, 
                position tells you neither what the vowel is, where it is, in 
                what part of the word it occurs, whether it is before a consonant 
                or after a consonant, nor supposing it is, say, a first-place 
                vowel, which particular first-place vowel or diphthong it is. 
                In point of fact, if you try to decipher an outline apart from 
                context, you may have to run through a dozen words before you 
                hit upon the correct one.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent issue of the 
              <em>Stenographer and Phonographic World</em>, Mr. W. J. Burrows 
              said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When words are written 
                in position there is far too much guesswork. Only one vowel can 
                thus be indicated, and the reader has at least three guesses as 
                to its place in the word, viz., initial, middle, or end. This 
                means eighteen guesses as to the nature or whereabouts of&#8212;what? 
                the principal vowel! As to what happens to be the principal vowel 
                there is nearly as much uncertainty in far too many cases.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing methods of 
              expressing vowels, Mr. Edward Pocknell, the author of &#8220;Legible 
              Shorthand,&#8221; who used Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand for over thirty 
              years as a professional reporter in London, said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not a hundred times 
                more difficult to remember on the spur of the moment whether a 
                phonographic arbitrary form should be placed above, on, or through 
                the line, according to the vowel sound, often obscure?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A talented Boston reporter, 
              Mr. Bates Torrey, said:</p>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although position is an 
              ingenious device, and in the strictness of its phonetic application 
              conducive to legibility of writing, yet at times it falls short 
              of the purpose for which it was designed&#8212;simply because so 
              many words have the same vocal elements. Note the unchanged positions 
              called for in the words <em>knee</em>, <em>nigh</em>, <em>gnaw</em>; 
              in <em>like</em>, <em>leak</em>, <em>lock</em>, <em>ilk</em>, <em>lick</em>&#8212;all 
              being same-position sounds.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. David Wolfe Brown, in his book, 
              &#8220;The Factors of Shorthand Speed,&#8221; in detailing the difficulties 
              which students encounter, said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thus unskilled as 
                to the requirements of the reporting style, he must not only think 
                out the whole outline before starting to write it, but with the 
                outline mentally suspended, must decide which of perhaps half-a-dozen 
                vowels (heard possibly none too distinctly) is the one which should 
                determine the &#8220;reporting position&#8221; of the outline. 
                . . . I ask them to write some word, not very difficult, but which 
                they have never written before; and they hesitate painfully. The 
                pen seems unwilling or unable to touch the paper. Mind and hand 
                appear paralyzed. &#8220;What boggles you?&#8221; I ask; and they 
                reply, &#8220;Oh, I can write the outline but I am trying to think 
                of the position!&#8221; This is often their pitiable plight after 
                they have been writing shorthand for months and months!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another place he describes 
              the &#8220;indication&#8221; of the vowels by position as &#8220;generally 
              vague, unsuggestive, and practically useless.&#8221;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus an outline which, 
                ignoring artificial rules of &#8220;position&#8221; is so vocalized 
                as to express the essential vowel, will often be written in less 
                time than an unvocalized outline carefully placed in &#8220;position,&#8221; 
                which, theoretically, is supposed to &#8220;indicate&#8221; the 
                omitted vowel, but whose &#8220;indication&#8221; is, for an unfamiliar 
                word (such as a proper name), generally vague, unsuggestive, and 
                practically useless.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;Undoubtedly 
              a Hindrance.&#8221; &#8212;</strong> Even that ever-loyal devotee 
              of Phonography, Mr~ E. A. Cope, in a discussion before the Shorthand 
              Society, is thus reported: &#8220;Mr. Cope&#8217;s experience led 
              him to w&#8217;ish for the abolition of position as much as possible. 
              It was undoubtedly a hindrance.&#8221; (<em>Shorthand</em>, Volume 
              I., Page 114.)<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably there is no higher authority 
              on rapid shorthand writing among Pitman writers in England than 
              Mr. W. McDougall. In a letter published in Commercial Education 
              for October 20, 1915, Mr. McDougall said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the difficulty 
                in the Phonographic outlines themselves, my own experience is 
                that in many cases where the word allows of position-writing at 
                moderate speeds, at the highest speeds this position-writing must 
                go by the board. It is practicable only in the case of the shorter 
                words where the rule serves to distinguish between different words 
                represented by the consonantal outline Applied to outlines which 
                represent more words than one, it is doubtless helpful in the 
                reading of the notes, but beyond this it becomes both impracticable 
                and unnecessary, and the speed aspirant would do well to ignore 
                the innovation or he will find himself hindered rather than helped.</p>

            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editor of Commercial 
              Education makes this comment:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are quite in agreement 
                with our correspondent. . . . Some theorists seem to look upon 
                position-writing as a virtue in itself instead of being, as it 
                undoubtedly is, only a necessary makeshift for, distinguishing 
                words that cannot be otherwise distinguished.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The &#8220;Appreciable&#8221; 
              Losses. &#8212;</strong> The <em>Phonographic Magazine</em> (the 
              organ of the Benn Pitman system) for December, 1912, in an answer 
              to a correspondent, makes a very significant statement about the 
              time lost in placing words &#8220;in position.&#8221; After stating 
              that certain words belong to certain positions&#8212;above, on, 
              or through the line&#8212;the editor says:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, unnecessary 
                to write these long outlines in position, as the bare outline 
                of each written on the line is sufficient for all purposes of 
                legibility whenever the word appears in context, i. e., <em>sentences</em>. 
                And there is an especial disadvantage in doing the unnecessary 
                in shorthand. The time and effort consumed is infinitesimal in 
                a single instance, but the shorthand reporter writes words by 
                the hundreds of thousands and by the millions, and the sum of 
                these infinitesimal losses soon becomes very appreciable. In teaching, 
                therefore (which means, in the cultivation of working habits in 
                the learner), these outlines written unnecessarily in position 
                should be treated as errors, and the student should be admonished 
                not to waste time in doing the unnecessary.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to say: When the 
              student places the forms in the correct position, the words should 
              be treated as errors, if, <em>in the judgment of the teacher</em>, 
              it is <em>unnecessary</em> to place them in position. Beautifully 
              definite, is it not?<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most significant is the admission 
              that there is a loss of time and effort in placing the words in 
              position, and that in continuous writing <em>the sum of these infinitesimal 
              losses soon becomes appreciable</em>. Yet we have heard people make 
              the absurd assertion that there is no loss of time in placing words 
              above, through, or below the line.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement of the <em>Phonographic 
              Magazine</em> that &#8220;outlines written unnecessarily in position 
              should be treated as errors&#8221; is but another illustration of 
              the absurdities and inconsistencies of the old-time systems of shorthand. 
              The student has to spend many tedious hours in learning to do things 
              one way, only to be told that if he does it that way he may be penalized 
              for errors. In other words, to be right is to be wrong.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;Position&#8221; Means 
              Loss of Time and Effort. &#8212;</strong> I could quote volumes 
              of similar expressions from well-known teachers and reporters on 
              both sides of the Atlantic, but there is no need to do so. Every 
              candid teacher and writer will acknowledge that position-writing 
              is one of the greatest obstacles to the attainment of speed. There 
              is mental effort in thinking ahead about the position in which words 
              should be placed; there is physical effort in dodging from one position 
              to another, instead of proceeding continuously along the line of 
              writing. As the distinguished congressional reporter, David Wolfe 
              Brown, said: &#8220;The more often you depart from the line of writing, 
              the greater the labor for the hand, and the less the speed.&#8221; 
              Henry Richter, former President of the Shorthand Society, London, 
              said: &#8220;Position writing, if used to a great extent, requires 
              a constant jumping about, and thus wastes valuable time, besides 
              unduly tiring both hand and brain.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is position-writing a tax 
              on the memory and a constant source of hesitation, but the changing 
              of the position of the hand in placing the words&#8212;now above, 
              now below, now on the line&#8212;interferes with both speed and 
              legibility.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of &#8220;position&#8221; 
              is an obstacle to easy, natural and legible phrase-writing, for 
              when the words are joined to one another without lifting the pen 
              some of them must be written <em>out of position</em>. The result 
              is that those words out of position lose their identity, so far 
              as the vowels are concerned. As sometimes as many as twenty words 
              may be written by the same sign in disjoined-vowel systems, some 
              idea of the ensuing confusion may be gleaned.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no position-writing in longhand, 
              and if longhand is to be our standard for natural writing, then 
              position-writing is inadmissible.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our system is free from &#8220;position 
              rules,&#8221; the writing in it flows steadily onward without loss 
              of momentum, and with the hand always in the right place to begin 
              the next word without any ineffectual &#8220;air-traveling&#8221; 
              from the end of one outline to the beginning of the next one. Good 
              phrase-forms, too, are not destroyed as they are in other systems 
              where certain words in the phrase have to be placed above or below 
              the line&#8212;or treated as &#8220;exceptions.&#8221;</p>

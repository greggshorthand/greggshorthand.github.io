            </div>
            <p align="center"><strong>&#8220;TO SHADE OR NOT TO SHADE&#8221;</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 
              the last two chapters were written there has been a discussion of 
              this subject under the above title at a meeting of the National 
              Shorthand Reporters&#8217; Association.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a supplement to what I have written 
              I am printing the remarks I made in the course of the discussion:<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. President, I think you will realize 
              that this is a subject in which I am particularly interested. I 
              ask your permission to say a few words on the subject.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a truism to say that we are 
              creatures of habit&#8212;habit of thought and habit of practice. 
              I believe that in shorthand matters this is particularly true. The 
              practice of a particular style of shorthand for a long time seems 
              to create both mental and physical grooves which render it almost 
              impossible to think of other principles or other forms than those 
              with which we are familiar.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Shorthand Systems the Product 
              of Youth. &#8212;</strong> This is strikingly illustrated in shorthand 
              by the fact that there has been no system of shorthand produced 
              in any country that has achieved any marked success which was not 
              published soon after its author was out of his teens; that is to 
              say, before he became so fully imbued with certain principles or 
              with certain methods of writing that it was impossible for him to 
              dissociate his thoughts from them. As the late Charles Currier Beale 
              pointed out at one of these conventions, Isaac Pitman published 
              his system at the age of twenty-four. Even the most original of 
              the modifiers of the Pitman system, Mr. Graham and Mr. Munson, published 
              their first works when they were twenty-four and twenty-nine respectively. 
              Duploy&eacute;, the author of the most popular of the French systems, 
              was twenty-six when he first published his system, and Gabelsberger, 
              the author of the most popular of the German systems, was twenty-seven, 
              when after years of study he produced his great system. Incidentally 
              I may mention that my system was published when I was twenty.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no hope of convincing many 
              of you of the great advantages which I believe are derived from 
              the abolition of shading, simply because long practice has accustomed 
              you to it; but I do believe I can at least set some of you to thinking 
              about the subject in a way in which perhaps you have not thought 
              about it before.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said about habits of thought 
              and practice are shown in the case of the previous speaker. He has 
              been a writer and advocate of Lindsley&#8217;s Takigrafy for many 
              years. The result is seen in all that he has written, and in the 
              paper he has just read. Lindsley&#8217;s Takigrafy was largely a 
              modification of a Pitmanic system with these important variations&#8212;connective 
              vowels and greater lineality, the latter being secured by the adoption 
              of horizontal characters for <em>t</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>s</em>, 
              <em>z</em>. Where Pitmanic theory and practice is in accordance 
              with Takigrafy, he endorses Pitmanic with enthusiasm; where Takigrafy 
              differs from Phonography he endorses the Lindsley theory of practice. 
              For instance, he condemns the use of the downward right diagonal 
              (<em>ch</em> in Pitman) and the upward oblique (<em>ray</em> in 
              Pitman) for different purposes. Why? Simply because Lindsley&#8217;s 
              Takigrafy uses that character written <em>either</em> upward or 
              downward for the same purpose.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I contend, and I believe that 
              most of you will agree with me, whatever system you write, that 
              there is much more danger of confusing the vertical <em>t</em> with 
              the oblique characters <em>p</em> or <em>ch</em>, in rapid writing 
              than there is of confusing <em>ch</em> and <em>r</em>. The characters 
              for <em>ch</em> and <em>r</em> differ not only in direction and 
              slant but they are very seldom standing alone either in Pitmanic 
              shorthand or in Gregg shorthand. That is just an illustration of 
              how long practice of Takigrafy has given a mental bias to his views 
              of others systems.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Question of Shading. &#8212;</strong> 
              Much that has been said is absolutely irrelevant to the subject, 
              but I shall try to keep myself strictly to the point at issue&#8212;shading. 
              It all resolves itself into a question of loss and gain. I do not 
              suppose that I need to argue that it takes longer to make a thick 
              character than a light character. Mr. Andrew J. Graham stated that 
              his investigations showed that it required ten percent more time 
              to make a shaded character than to make a light character. Mr. McDermut, 
              of Chicago, one of our most valued members, who passed away last 
              year, stated that his investigations had convinced him that Mr. 
              Graham had placed too low a figure on the loss occasioned by shading, 
              which he said was at least thirty per cent. Suppose we put it at 
              twenty percent.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>All Script Systems Not Light 
              Line. &#8212;</strong> The previous speaker referred to &#8220;script 
              systems&#8221; as if all script systems were light-line systems. 
              As a matter of fact, all the script systems that appeared before 
              the publication of my system were shaded systems; since then there 
              have been two or three imitations of our system without shading. 
              The question of shading has nothing to do with the script or cursive 
              style of shorthand. On the other hand, there have been Pit-manic 
              systems free from shading. For instance, there is a light-line shorthand 
              by Mr. Thornton, an official reporter of high standing in Buffalo&#8212;and 
              with whom I had the pleasure of dining a short time ago&#8212;and 
              I learned today that it is represented by an official reporter who 
              is at this meeting. Now Mr. Thornton&#8217;s system is a Pitmanic 
              shorthand, but it is free from shading, and Mr. Thornton claims 
              an advantage on that account of twenty-five per cent in facility 
              of writing. But, as I said before, let us put it at twenty percent.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a factor, too, that is not 
              often taken into account in considering these things, and that is 
              the pause which must necessarily take place after each shaded character. 
              It is very slight, but the hand must adjust itself to varying degrees 
              of pressure. This is especially noticeable where straight characters 
              are written in the same direction, one shaded and the next light, 
              or vice versa, as in the case of <em>bp</em>, or <em>pb</em>, <em>kg</em>, 
              or <em>gk</em>, or <em>dt</em>.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How Shading Affects Lineality. 
              &#8212;</strong> The next factor is that of lineality or horizontality. 
              In a statement made somewhere else by the previous speaker, he said 
              that the horizontality of the writing in our system was &#8220;phenomenally 
              high, over 90 percent, giving a remarkably close adherence to the 
              normal line of writing,&#8221; while the writing in Pitmanic shorthand 
              had less than fifty per cent of horizontality. Now what does that 
              mean? It means that in writing our system the hand of the writer 
              at the end of a word-form or phrase-form is in position to begin 
              the next one. There are much fewer ineffectual movements. You will 
              all recognize the importance of that. Suppose we put the gain in 
              that respect at ten per cent, which I think is a very conservative 
              figure. That makes a gain of thirty percent.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you do not see what bearing 
              the absence of shading has on the question of lineality. Well, the 
              history of the shading principle as generally used is a very interesting 
              one. Isaac Pitman has stated that he had been a writer of Taylor&#8217;s 
              system, which he learned from the Harding edition of that system. 
              Harding distinguished <em>v</em> from <em>f</em> and <em>z</em> 
              from <em>s</em> by shading&#8212;you will find the full story of 
              this in Graham&#8217;s <em>Student&#8217;s Journal</em>&#8212;and 
              Mr. Pitman in telling the story of the invention of the system said 
              that it immediately occurred to him to extend this method of distinguishing 
              letters to all the phonetic pairs. In carrying out that idea he 
              naturally gave the most frequent pairs of letters the downward direction, 
              since shading could not be applied to upward characters very well, 
              or even to horizontal characters with any facility. As you know, 
              the result has been that many of the most frequent letters are struck 
              downward, like <em>t</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>z</em>, one 
              of the forms for <em>l</em> and one of the forms for <em>r</em>. 
              That is why the writing in Pitmanic shorthand always tends downward.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that Takigrafy has greater 
              lineality than Pit-manic shorthand, which I think explains the emphasis 
              placed on that point by the previous speaker, but in Takigrafy it 
              is obtained with an increase in the number of shaded strokes in 
              a <em>horizontal</em> direction. I think I am perfectly safe in 
              saying that, even if you approve of shading as a sort of &#8220;necessary 
              evil,&#8221; you would not care to increase the number of shaded 
              characters in a horizontal direction. On account of the absence 
              of shading I was able to select horizontal lines to represent some 
              of the most numerous letters, <em>n</em>, <em>m</em>, <em>r</em>, 
              <em>l</em>, which accounts for the phenomenally high degree of horizontality 
              in our writing.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Shading an Arbitrary Expedient. 
              &#8212;</strong> The previous speaker made a somewhat elaborate 
              argument to demonstrate that it was more natural to distinguish 
              the phonetic pairs by shading. It may seem more natural to him because 
              long practice has made it familiar to him. I believe it is more 
              natural to both mind and hand to distinguish by length. It is very 
              natural to say and to think that &#8220; as the sound strengthens 
              the stroke lengthens.&#8221; It is certainly more natural to the 
              hand to make the distinction by lengthening, since that is the method 
              used in longhand in distinguishing <em>e</em> from <em>l</em>, and 
              so forth; and in longhand writing there is no such thing as compulsory 
              shading.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the gains, just 
              some of them, from the elimination of shading. I need hardly speak 
              of the freedom of mind and hand which the absence of shading must 
              give. That will have occurred to all of you.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Halving Expedient Discussed. 
              &#8212;</strong> Now what do we lose through the abolition of shading? 
              Simply the half-lengthening expedient to add <em>t</em> or <em>d</em>. 
              I wonder how many of you ever analyzed how much is gained by the 
              halving expedient. The purpose of it is not so much the addition 
              of <em>t</em> or <em>d</em> as the keeping of the writing to the 
              line. Without the halving principle the entire body of the writing 
              would tend downward. The previous speaker has stated that the horizontality 
              in Pitmanic shorthand was less than fifty percent. Without the halving 
              principle, it would be much less, as you will all realize.<br />
              The argument as stated was that as we used the half-length for the 
              first letter of the pairs, that is <em>p</em>, <em>t</em>, etc., 
              and the full length for <em>b</em>, <em>d</em>, etc., we were losing 
              time in making the longer character. Besides this, he said, we cannot 
              add <em>t</em> or <em>d</em> by halving. Very good. Let us examine 
              that statement.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would make is this: 
              that all the alphabetic characters in Pitmanic Shorthand are full 
              length strokes. Mr. Graham computed that a full-length could be 
              written only ninety-five times while a half-length was being written 
              one hundred times. We have therefore, a decided advantage in that 
              fact, because one-half of the alphabetic characters in our system 
              are half-length, and these characters for <em>t</em>, <em>p</em>, 
              <em>f</em>, <em>r</em>, <em>n</em>, etc., are far more frequent 
              than the full-length letters.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Is the Halving Expedient Logical? 
              &#8212;</strong> Next, what does the half-length represent in Pitmanic 
              shorthand? This character [illustrating] represents <em>p</em>; 
              when it is written half-length it becomes <em>pt</em>. In other 
              words, the half-length is assigned to the less useful purpose, because 
              manifestly the combination <em>pt</em> is not nearly so frequent 
              as the single letter <em>p</em>. Did you ever think of that?<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one writer expressed it, you &#8220;subtract 
              to multiply.&#8221; It is not logical or natural to do this. There 
              was an article in the Phonographic World many years ago&#8212;I 
              think in 1893&#8212;called &#8220;The Requiem of the Halving Principle,&#8221; 
              by a Mr. John H. Hotson, an accomplished Pitmanic writer. Mr. Hotson 
              built up his argument from the basis of Mr. Graham&#8217;s computation 
              about short and long characters, to show that if all the basic characters 
              of the phonetic pairs are represented by half-lengths and <em>t</em> 
              and <em>d</em> added by lengthening instead of halving, there would 
              be a great gain in compactness and facility. The article was illustrated 
              by comparisons of matter written both ways. Personally, I think 
              that Mr. Hotson&#8217;s theory is absolutely correct in practice, 
              and it certainly is logical.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Since this discussion I have looked 
              up Mr. Hotson&#8217;s article &#8220;The Requiem of the Halving 
              Principle,&#8221; Phonographic World, April, 1894, and the following 
              quotation from it will make his argument clear to the reader:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 
                incontrovertible calculations from indisputable facts and figures 
                published by Mr. A. J. Graham in his &#8220;Handbook,&#8221; I 
                worked out, in an article entitled &#8220;Comparative Brevity,&#8221; 
                in the July (1893) number of the Phonographic World, results showing 
                the comparative length of time occupied in writing every stroke 
                and character entering into the composition of shorthand. For 
                example, the time occupied in writing an initial small hook was 
                found to be half of the time occupied in writing a full-length 
                stroke; a small circle was found to equal 70 percent of a stroke; 
                a lifting was found to consume 36 percent of the time taken to 
                write a full-length stroke; a half-length stroke was found to 
                consume 92 percent of the time of a full-length stroke, etc., 
                etc. It is from these facts that I propose to prove that the halving 
                principle is an utter failure in producing real brevity.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the halving principle were abolished 
                entirely from a system in which it is now used, the alphabetical 
                stroke would become the smallest stem stroke, and the present 
                full-lengths could then be written the size of the present half-lengths, 
                thus effecting a saving in point of time of 8 percent on every 
                one of such present full-lengths.]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often 
              can you apply the halving principle? One writer who made a careful 
              analysis of Graham writing, in which the use of the expedient is 
              pushed to a greater extreme than in any other system, stated that 
              it could be used only in about sixty per cent of all the occurrences 
              of <em>t</em> or <em>d</em>. In Taylor&#8217;s <em>Commentary on 
              Pitman Shorthand</em>, published by Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, there 
              are, I believe, fifteen pages devoted to the explanation of when 
              it cannot be used.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were not for the fact that it 
              <em>helps</em> to keep the writing to the line in Pitmanic shorthand, 
              the half-length expedient would not be worth what it costs even 
              in Pitmanic shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Variable Lengths. &#8212;</strong> 
              Before leaving this subject I should like to take exception to the 
              constant reference to &#8220;triple lengths&#8221; in Pitmanic Shorthand. 
              In reality there are four lengths in constant use, and occasionally 
              a fifth length. There are but three lengths in our system. In Isaac 
              Pitman Shorthand there are the following outlines [illustrating] 
              for <em>due</em>, <em>admit</em>, <em>deem</em>, <em>diameter</em>, 
              in four lengths. You can write this: &#8220;You met my mother&#8221; 
              (four lengths), or &#8220;You met my mother there&#8221; (five lengths), 
              or &#8220;You met my lawyer&#8217;s mother&#8217;s motor there.&#8221; 
              I could go on illustrating this indefinitely.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, my friends, I do not expect many 
              of you to understand fully all that I have said on this subject, 
              or to agree with me, because you are not accustomed to a different 
              mode of practice. All I ask is that you keep an open mind on the 
              subject, remembering that all the alleged losses described are offset 
              by advantages which, to my mind, far outweigh them. If it were true 
              that the losses were very great, then our system would be a very 
              slow system. But you know that it has been written in the contests 
              held by this Association at 196 words a minute on solid matter, 
              237 words a minute on jury charge, and 268 on testimony, by a young 
              man who was then only nineteen years of age, and who is today the 
              official reporter to the President of the United States. And the 
              system is young! There does not seem to be much loss on account 
              of the elimination of shading in those records, does there?</p>

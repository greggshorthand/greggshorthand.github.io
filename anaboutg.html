            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>History.</strong> Gregg Shorthand 
              was first published in 1888, in two little paper-covered pamphlets, 
              under the title, &quot;Light-Line Phonography.&quot; Five years 
              later, a revised and greatly improved edition was published under 
              the title, 'Gregg Shorthand.' It was not until 1897, however, that 
              the author was able to publish the system in book form.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To the student or writer of shorthand, there 
              are few more interesting or inspiring stories of success than the 
              story of the career of Gregg Shorthand in the thirty-two years that 
              have elapsed since its publication in book form; but a textbook 
              is not a place for such a story. Today, Gregg Shorthand is the standard 
              system of America. It has been adopted exclusively in the public 
              schools of 6,519 cities and towns more than ninety-seven per cent 
              of the public schools that teach shorthand. It has superseded the 
              older systems, in the large majority of these cases, by formal action 
              of the Boards of Education after careful investigation of the merit 
              of the system. Its leadership in all other kinds of educational 
              institutions is equally pronounced. This constitutes the highest 
              educational indorsement a shorthand system has ever received.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Wins World Championship Six Times.</strong> 
              The history of Gregg Shorthand is a record of public triumphs. In 
              the 1921 World&#8217;s Championship Contest of the National Shorthand 
              Reporters&#8217; Association, Mr. Albert Schneider* won first place, 
              defeated three former champions, and established two world's records. 
              He transcribed the 215-words-a-minute literary dictation with a 
              net speed of 211.2 words a minute; accuracy, 98.32%. On the 200-words-a-minute 
              dictation his accuracy percentage was 98.80; on the 240-words-a-minute 
              dictation, 98.17; on the 280-words-a-minute dictation,<br />
              96.84.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In transcribing five five-minute highest speed 
              dictations 175, 200, 215, 240, and 280 words a minute in the time 
              allotted for the three championship dictations, Mr. Schneider gave 
              one of the most remarkable demonstrations of transcribing ability 
              in the history of the shorthand contests.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Writers of Gregg Shorthand won first, second, 
              and third places in the World&#8217;s Championship Contest of the 
              National Shorthand Reporters&#8217; Association in 1923. Mr. Charles 
              L. Swem,<a href="anaboutg.shtml#one">*</a> winner, established a world&#8217;s 
              record on the 200-words-a-minute dictation, making but two errors; 
              accuracy, 99.79%. On the 240-words-a-minute dictation, his accuracy 
              was 98.49%; on the 280 dictation, 99.36%. Second place was won by 
              Mr. Albert Schneider, a Gregg writer, the 1921 champion. His average 
              accuracy was 98.80%. Third place was won by another Gregg writer, 
              Mr. Martin J. Dupraw, with an accuracy of 98.76%. <em>First place 
              in accuracy in every dictation was won by a writer of Gregg Shorthand.</em><br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the 1924 World&#8217;s Championship, Mr. 
              Swem was again the victor. Mr. Swem&#8217;s accuracy on the three 
              dictations was 99.23%.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the three consecutive years, 1925, I926, 
              and 1927, the Worlds Shorthand Championship was won by Mr. Martin 
              J. Dupraw, the greatest shorthand writer the world has yet produced. 
              By winning the championship in 1927, Mr. Dupraw won permanent possession 
              of the World&#8217;s Shorthand Championship Trophy, first offered 
              in 1909 by the National Shorthand Reporters&#8217; Association.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Highest Shorthand Speed Records.</strong> 
              The following are the world&#8217;s highest shorthand speed records 
              all held by writers of Gregg Shorthand and made in the Championship 
              Contests of the National Shorthand Reporters<br />
              Association:</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gregg Shorthand is the only system that has 
              produced three different writers to win the World Championship in 
              the contests of the National Shorthand Reporters&#8217; Association. 
              The contests were discontinued in 1927, and Mr. Dupraw was given 
              permanent possession of the World&#8217;s Championship Trophy.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Wins New York State Shorthand Championship.</strong> 
              In the contest of the New York State Shorthand Reporters&#8217; 
              Association, 1924, Mr. Martin J. Dupraw won first place with an 
              accuracy record of 99.5%; Mr. Nathan Behrin, Supreme Court reporter, 
              New York City, second; and Mr. Harvey Forbes, Supreme Court reporter, 
              Buffalo, New York, third. By winning the New York State Shorthand 
              Championship again in 1925, and also in 1926, Mr. Dupraw gained 
              permanent possession of the Bottome Cup, the State championship 
              trophy.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Awarded Medal of Honor at Panama-Pacific 
              Exposition.</strong> At the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, 
              in 1915, Gregg Shorthand was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest 
              award ever granted a system of shorthand by any exposition, and 
              the only award ever granted that. was based on the results accomplished 
              by students in a model school conducted under the observation of 
              the International Jury of Awards. Gregg Shorthand also received 
              the highest award, the Medal of Honor, at the SesquiCentennial Exposition 
              at Philadelphia, in 1926. The thirteenth International Shorthand 
              Congress, held in Bruxelles, Belgium, in 1927, awarded a <em>Grand 
              Prix</em> to The Gregg Publishing Company, and elected the author 
              of Gregg Shorthand as Vice President of the Congress representing 
              the United States.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Principles of the System.</strong> Needless 
              to say, Gregg Shorthand is a radical departure from the old lines 
              of shorthand construction, for it is only by a radical departure 
              that such marked superiority in results can be accomplished.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The following is a synopsis of the leading features 
              of the system:<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. <em>No compulsory thickening</em>&#8212;may 
              be written either light or heavy.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. <em>Written on the slope of longhand</em>, 
              thus securing a uniform manual movement.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. <em>Position-writing abolished</em>&#8212;may 
              be written on unruled paper, ordinary<br />
              and in one straight line.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. <em>Vowels and consonants are joined</em>, 
              and follow each other in<br />
              their natural order.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. <em>Angles are rare</em>&#8212;curves predominate.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This brief synopsis will suffice to show that 
              the aim of the author has been to adhere to those natural principles 
              that govern ordinary writing. By a practical combination of these 
              elements as a foundation, the system secures to the writer, <em>with 
              very little practice</em>, that perfect command of the characters 
              that is productive of the best results, and is obtained only by 
              years of persistent, painstaking practice with the older systems.</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>TO SUM UP</strong></p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Easy to Learn.</strong> Gregg Shorthand 
              may be learned in from one-third to one-half the time required by 
              the old systems. The records made by its writers prove this beyond 
              all question.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Easy to Read.</strong> Gregg Shorthand 
              is the most legible shorthand in existence. In the public shorthand 
              speed contests, writers of the system have established the <em>highest 
              official world&#8217;s records for accuracy</em> of transcripts 
              on difficult matter. These records were made in competition with 
              experienced reporters who used the older systems, and in contests 
              conducted by reporters and teachers who wrote such systems. Manifestly, 
              the insertion of the vowels, the absence of shading, the elimination 
              of position-writing, and the elimination of the minute distinctions 
              of form, all contribute to legibility.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Easy to Write.</strong> The easy, natural 
              appearance of the writing in Gregg Shorthand appeals to every impartial 
              investigator. &nbsp;The absence of distinctions between light and 
              heavy characters, the continuous run of the writing along one line, 
              as in longhand, instead of constant changes of position now <em>on</em> 
              the line, then <em>above</em> the line, and then, perhaps, <em>through</em> 
              or <em>below</em> the line will be noticed at first glance. &nbsp;Next, 
              the investigator will probably attribute much of the natural, pleasing 
              appearance of the writing to that uniform slant of the writing with 
              which both hand and eye are familiar. &nbsp;Only those who have 
              had previous experience with shorthand, however, will be able to 
              appreciate fully how much elimination of numerous dots and dashes 
              minute marks that have to be placed with great precision alongside 
              the strokes contributes to fluent writing.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Superior in Speed Possibilities.</strong>&nbsp; 
              As has already been set forth in greater detail, writers of Gregg 
              Shorthand have demonstrated in public speed contests, under the 
              most trying conditions, that the system has greater speed possibilities 
              than any other system.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Adapted to Other Languages.</strong> 
              &nbsp;The simple and logical writing basis of Gregg Shorthand enables 
              a writer of it to use it in any language with which he or she is familiar. 
              Special adaptations of the system have been published for Spanish, 
              French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Gaelic, and Esperanto.&nbsp; 
              Adaptations to other languages are in preparation. &nbsp;The Spanish 
              adaptation of the system is used in more than 300 schools in Spanish-speaking 
              countries, and there is a quarterly magazine devoted to it.</p>
            <hr />
            <p><a name="one" id="one"></a>*Governor Woodrow Wilson selected Mr. Swem 
              as his official reporter in his campaign for the Presidency. Mr. 
              Swem was Personal Secretary and Official Reporter to President Wilson 
              for eight years. Mr. Swem began the study of Gregg Shorthand in 
              a night school in September, 1908, when working as an office boy. 
              He was twenty years of age when he received the appointment at the 
              White House. In the 1924 examination for the position of Supreme 
              Court stenographer in the state of New York, Mr. Swem won first 
              place in a field of 150 candidates. Mr. Swem did not accept an appointment 
              at the time, and took the examination in 1928, again winning first 
              place. He is at present an official shorthand reporter in the Supreme 
              Court of New York.</p>

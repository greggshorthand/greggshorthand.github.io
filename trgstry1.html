              Gregg shorthand<br />
              as he has told it when urged for reminiscences of the early days</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To begin at the very beginning we should have 
              to go to the little village of Rockcorry County Monaghan when I 
              was a child.&nbsp; My father had a friend named Annesley who came 
              to visit him over the weekend and he took Mr. Annesley with him 
              to church. &nbsp;Of course any stranger in that little church was 
              the cynosure of all eyes but when this stranger began to make notes 
              of the sermon (he was a shorthand writer which was quite unusual 
              in those days) he caused something like consternation. The minister 
              almost broke down during the sermon and studdered and stammered. 
              After the services he rushed out and begged Mr. Annesley not to 
              print the sermon because he had taken it from Spurgen or Talmadge 
              or some other great preacher of that time.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This incendent made such an impression on my 
              father that he insisted that all his children should learn shorthand. 
              &nbsp;Now I had the misfortune to be the youngest child and I had 
              the further misfortune to have just ahead of me a very brilliant 
              brother and a still more brilliant sister. &nbsp;My sister took 
              the first prize in every class she attended. My brother took the 
              first prize in the boys' school every year with one exception when 
              he got second place which he said was due to favoritism on the part 
              of the master for the boy who came first. &nbsp;They left their 
              schools with brilliant records and then four years later I came 
              along. &nbsp;I am sorry to confess that my record in school was 
              the exact reverse of those of my brother and my sister.&nbsp; My 
              nominal position in class was </p>

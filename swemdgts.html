              proved a &quot;hazard&quot; to your speed, too, you'll welcome this

            <p align="center"><em>By </em>Charles Lee Swem<em><br />
              Former Official Shorthand Reporter, New York Supreme Court</em></p>
            <p align="left"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the most perplexing problems 
              of fast shorthand writing is not a shorthand problem at all. It 
              has to do with those truly remarkable but troublesome inventions 
              of the Arabs called digits&#8212;0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. &nbsp;The 
              writing of them is not a shorthand problem because we do not usually 
              translate them into shorthand. They are of themselves as brief as 
              any shorthand character that can be devised for them and, besides, 
              they are highly distinctive and therefore meet two of the three 
              vitally important shorthand requirements. The third requirement 
              which they do not meet is the element of phrasing, and it is because 
              of that lack that they are the troublemakers that they are.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To overcome this lack to some extent, we do 
              translate them into shorthand in all instances where by so doing 
              we can secure a brief, distinctive phrase. Thus, instead of employing 
              the digits, we use the brief and distinctive shorthand outlines 
              for <em>one or two, two or three, three or four, four or five, nine 
              or ten</em>, and the fractional phrases of <em>one-half</em>, <em>two-thirds</em>, 
              and <em>three-quarters</em>, as well as the more commonly used combinations 
              of figures that lend themselves to that most important of all speed 
              expedients&#8212;phrasing.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any sequence of short outlines that must be 
              written separately, without the saving relief of phrasing, becomes 
              both a mental and a manual hazard requiring the highest possible 
              skill to overcome. The shorter the individual outlines, the greater 
              the hazard. This hazard is tremendously enhanced when figures are 
              involved, since figures have no context and slide off the mind into 
              forgetfulness if they are not caught and fixed instantly. Most expert 
              writers can permit themselves to get from fifteen to twenty words 
              behind a speaker and yet not lose a single word, but it is only 
              by the rarest concentration that a writer can suffer himself to 
              lag even three or four digits behind a speaker, without transposing 
              or entirely forgetting some of them.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not think there is anything more difficult 
              to report than the cross examination of a real estate expert in 
              what is generally termed a tax appeal case, where the witness and 
              the cross-examiner may delve into building values, rent rolls, reproduction 
              costs, operating expenses, and the complicated details of the mathematical 
              formulae that are used to determine units of value&#8212;all, indeed, 
              the most routine stuff, and because it is routine it should be simple 
              and easy. But because it deals largely with figures it becomes less 
              a matter of shorthand than of sheer concentration and the ability 
              to write the 1, 2, 3, 4's that we learned before we ever dreamed 
              of writing shorthand.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The skill necessary to do this type of reporting 
              and to do it well does not come front ordinary shorthand practice. 
              The figure content of most material on which the reporter usually 
              writes, consisting of dates, casual amounts, and costs of commodities, 
              does not fit him to write for pages at a time fast testimony in 
              which figures predominate. Most reporters, I fear, have never made 
              any special effort to become the expert in writing figures that 
              they have in writing shorthand. Most of us have depended solely 
              upon experience for this type of skill, feeling that figures, after 
              all, are figures; that we have been writing them much longer than 
              we have been writing shorthand, and therefore know them better than 
              we do our shorthand. It is a common complaint among writers that 
              figures are hard to get when they are spoken fast, because once 
              the writer gets behind the speaker it is impossible to catch up 
              again&#8212;there is no context to help keep figures impressed on 
              the mind.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is quite true. One cannot get more than 
              a very few digits behind and be certain that he makes an accurate 
              report The way one can report figures accurately is always to keep 
              up with the speaker and never get behind more than two or three 
              digits. That, I suspect, sounds like an over-simplification of the 
              problem, and yet I believe it is a very simple solution, possible 
              to any writer. For, be it realized, I am not now speaking of shorthand 
              speed; I am speaking only of writing the Arabic numerals that we 
              have all been writing since our kindergarten days.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The writing of figures, after all, calls for 
              but two simple fundamental skills&#8212; the manual ability to form 
              the digits fast enough, and the other, concentration&#8212; both 
              of them abilities found to a high degree in many people who are 
              not shorthand writers and who may not possess the other qualities 
              requisite to shorthand skill The point I make is that if this skill 
              is not to be found in the average competent reporter it is because 
              he has never bethought himself of the necessity of practicing on 
              ordinary, everyday figures.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe I can best illustrate what can be 
              done in the writing of figures by reciting a personal experience. 
              Once upon a time, I could write 280 words a minute. Indeed, not 
              to be too modest about it, I quite early found no great difficulty 
              in Writing at that speed, so long as the speaker confined himself 
              to words. But when at high speed he wandered off the beaten track 
              and got into figures, I would invariably experience that most annoying 
              shorthand malady of not being able to keep up. Surely, I thought, 
              I should be able to write figures as well as shorthand, for weren't 
              figures just as brief as shorthand, and I had certainly written 
              enough of them to be able to write them as fast and fluently as 
              any shorthand character I knew?<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fact turned out to be that I had not actually 
              written them as much as I had written shorthand, and that was why 
              I could not write them as rapidly as I could write shorthand. On 
              an inspiration, I got out the stop watch and, writing nothing but 
              figures, repeating from 1 to 0 over and over again for a full minute, 
              I discovered that, although I could write 280 words a minute in 
              shorthand, the best I could do on figures was 220 words a minute. 
              Recovering from my surprise, I recast my shorthand practice program 
              and began from that moment to spend a large part of my daily practice 
              effort on figure penmanship. The time came when I boosted that 220 
              to 240 words a minute, and there I remained for quite a long period.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Partly because it was one of those natural speed 
              &#8220;ruts&#8221; that all writers get into, I remained at that 
              speed, but partly, also, I discovered, it was because there was 
              a mental hazard in the writing of figures which has its counterpart 
              sometimes in the writing of shorthand. This hazard had to do with 
              the figure 5. I found I had great trouble at high speed in getting 
              past the figure 5 in any sequence in which it occurred: All the 
              other digits, with the exception of the figure 4, were written with 
              one continuous stroke of the pen, but that totally irrelevant tick 
              that was needed to complete the 5 was a source of confusion that 
              disrupted all my efforts to increase my manual speed.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Writing as I was at the highest speed of which 
              I was capable, completely automatically, that extra tick for the 
              5, so totally out of character with the rest of the digits, very 
              often sufficed in my subconscious mind for the figure following 
              it, with the result that I would omit the 6. This was had enough 
              from the standpoint of accuracy, but the fact that the 6 was omitted 
              would register somewhere in my mental machinery. Immediately an 
              attempt would be made to correct the error by inserting the 6 somewhere 
              else, the whole process throwing me into a mental tailspin and hopeless 
              confusion.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This mental hazard I eventually eliminated 
              by adopting a character for 5 which omits the tick, and writing 
              the figure more like a shallow capital S. This character I found 
              to be both facile and distinctive. The immediate result was to increase 
              my writing speed of the digits about five words a minute; but, more 
              important still, there was no more mental or co&ouml;rdinating hazard 
              left, and with further practice I eventually succeeded in raising 
              my writing speed on digits to 280 words a minute.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I must confess that I did not reach this speed 
              immediately but, by continuing to practice figures for the next 
              several months, I overcame both the manual and the psychological 
              hazard involved.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The writing of figures must be learned as shorthand 
              is learned, by systematic repetitive practice. Because they are 
              not a shorthand problem, figures are too often forgotten by the 
              average writer. Writing them, over and over again as shorthand is 
              practiced, should be part of the practice program of every writer 
              who hopes to become a competent, all-round reporter.</p>

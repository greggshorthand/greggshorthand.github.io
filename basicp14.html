            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed in writing depends 
                [among other things] upon the use of forms favoring lineality 
                of writing.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212;Andrew 
                J. Graham</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dictionary defines 
              &#8220;lineal&#8221; as &#8220;in a direct line. Lineality in shorthand 
              writing is understood to mean writing that keeps to the line instead 
              of running in a downward or in an upward direction.&nbsp; It is 
              obvious that if the writing descends below the line of writing, 
              or shoots upward, there is an <em>ineffectual movement</em> in getting 
              back to the line.&nbsp; The great English philosopher, Herbert Spencer, 
              in discussing shorthand systems, described such ineffectual efforts 
              as the &#8220;unregistered movements of the pen.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Value of Continuous Movement. 
              &#8212;</strong> In comparing shorthand systems the importance of 
              lineality&#8212;the continuous movement of the hand along the line&#8212;is 
              too often overlooked; and yet it is a factor of paramount importance.&nbsp; 
              When comparing systems it is a good plan to note <em>how many characters 
              end beneath the line</em>; that is, how many &#8220;unregistered 
              movements of the pen&#8221; there are between the shorthand forms.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When properly understood, this matter 
              of lineality makes clear some otherwise inexplicable events in shorthand 
              history. We constantly see references to the extraordinary vitality 
              of the systems of Gurney and Taylor&#8212; the former having been 
              in existence nearly two centuries, and the latter considerably more 
              than a century. The explanation of the longevity of these old systems 
              is to be found in the fact that they are free from shading and position 
              writing; consequently the authors were able to select lineal, easy 
              characters for the most frequent letters. The writing although lengthy, 
              is more like a free, onward running script&#8212;and therefore rapid.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a discussion of shorthand before 
              the Central Commercial Teachers&#8217; Association, Mr. A. C. Van 
              Sant, a Pit-manic writer, said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was trained to the 
                belief that the &#8220;Pitmanic&#8221; system was the only system 
                by which rapid note-making could be done. I went to Washington 
                in 1863, as clerk of the Committee of the District of Columbia 
                and I had a position assigned to me among the gallery reporters. 
                I looked down and saw one man whose hand was moving across the 
                page in apparently almost direct lines with wonderful rapidity, 
                turning off a sheet every few moments. I wondered what kind of 
                writing he was doing. I went down afterwards and made myself known, 
                and asked him what system he wrote. He replied, &#8220;the Gurney.&#8221; 
                &#8220;Is that rapid enough for congressional reporting?&#8221; 
                &#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is the most rapid system 
                in the world.&#8221; I said, &#8220;How is it with regard to accuracy 
                ?&#8221; &#8220;It is the most accurate system in the world,&#8221; 
                he said. Here was an upsetting of my views at once.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards I was employed on the 
                Chicago Tribune, and in a big political meeting with a man who 
                wrote the same system; three &#8216;of them reported the political 
                speeches, and when anyone wanted anything he was the man who made 
                the quickest answer.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter about shorthand, 
              which &#8216;appeared in the Chicago Daily News, an &#8220;ex-court 
              reporter of twenty-five years&#8217; experience&#8221; urged the 
              importance of simplicity of form. &#8220;Speed,&#8221; he said, 
              &#8220;comes when the forms for the words flow from the brain to 
              the fingers in an instantaneous vibration without effort or pause.&#8221; 
              Then he went on to say:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gurney system gives 
                outlines at least as extended as in the Pitman; yet the Gurney 
                men still do most of the work in English Parliamentary Committees; 
                and in 1900 two of the official reporters in New York courts, 
                deservedly famed for swiftness and accuracy, were Gurney men. 
                Of course, the Gurney system is a running script, which the Pitman 
                is not, and as to how far that equalizes matters is pure guesswork.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The &#8220;Unregistered 
              Movements.&#8221; &#8212;</strong> If the writing is of such a character 
              that it frequently leaves the hand below the line at the end of 
              a word or phrase, there is an ineffectual movement in getting back 
              to the line, or to the beginning of the next word. In many systems, 
              for example, the common letters, t and d, are represented by downward 
              characters, and as these letters are of very frequent occurrence, 
              the result is a general downward tendency to the writing. To counteract 
              this defect, such systems resort to other methods of expressing 
              these letters, which result in different ways of writing words and 
              consequently, in much hesitancy in execution.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Why Pitmanic Shorthand Straggles 
              Downward. &#8212;</strong> When such common letters as t, d, n, 
              m, r, l, are given a horizontal, onward direction, the result is 
              a very flowing, lineal movement, conducive to great facility of 
              execution. But, naturally, this may sometimes result in the writing 
              extending along the line and thus occupying more space, although 
              written with much less effort and with even fewer strokes than systems 
              requiring a constant up-and-down or zigzag motion.<br />
              In his keen, analytical criticism of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, Herbert 
              Spencer said, among other things:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not keep to the 
                line. This is an evil common to all shorthand hitherto published&#8212;an 
                evil productive not only of inelegance, but of great inconvenience, 
                and one which must seriously militate against the general adoption 
                of any method of writing which does not avoid it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another place he criticizes 
              the Pitman method of vocalization, because of &#8220;the motions 
              of the hand in going backward and forward to vocalize,&#8221; and 
              he terms these &#8220;the unregistered movements of the pencil.&#8221; 
              The same reasoning applies to unregistered movements from the end 
              of one word to the beginning of the next.<br />
              David Wolfe Brown, in commenting on Mr. Spencer&#8217;s views, said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever else we may 
                think of Herbert Spencer as a shorthand critic, there is at least 
                one of his remarks that should give us food for serious reflection.&nbsp; 
                It is undoubtedly true that &#8220;the unregistered movements&#8221;&#8212;those 
                in which the pen or pencil moves over the paper without touching 
                it&#8212;consume an equal amount of time with similar movements 
                that leave visible signs behind them.&nbsp; This being true, one 
                of the most obvious of shorthand lessons is to spend as little 
                time as possible in &#8220;unregistered movements&#8221;&#8212;in 
                executing unwritten strokes&#8212;in writing &#8220;in the air.&#8221;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the suggestions made 
              by Mr. Brown for reducing &#8220;the unwritten stroke&#8221; to 
              a minimum, is this:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By avoiding all unnecessary 
                carrying of the pen or pencil above or below the normal line of 
                writing.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew J. Graham, in stating the 
                &#8220;requirements of speed,&#8221; has well urged &#8220;the 
                use of forms favoring lineality of writing.&#8221;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A &#8220;Vicious 
              Principle.&#8221; &#8212;</strong> There is almost a pathetic note 
              in Mr. Brown&#8217;s concluding remarks:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most serious is the loss 
                suffered by the shorthand writer who needlessly resorts to &#8220;position,&#8221; 
                simply because &#8220;the accented vowel&#8221; happens to be 
                this or that or the other.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Position for the sake of distinction 
                between words of similar outline, I believe in; position for the 
                sake of &#8220;indicating the accented vowel&#8221; (which is 
                never thereby &#8220;indicated&#8221; in any sense of the term) 
                I deplore. If this effort to give to every shorthand outline a 
                position with reference to the &#8220;accented vowel&#8221; is 
                to go on unchecked, I expect to see rapid stenographic writers 
                become rarer and rarer, through the manual loss by sacrifice of 
                lineality, and the mental loss by undertaking to determine, with 
                reference to every written outline, a generally needless question 
                as to &#8220;the accented vowel.&#8221;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foremost exponent of 
              Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand among reporters in England for more than 
              half a century was Mr. Thomas Allen Reed.&nbsp; In his &#8220;Leaves 
              from My Note-Book&#8221; he expressed the opinion that &#8220;unless 
              a junction is easy and flowing, no time is saved;&#8221; and then 
              he went on to say, &#8220;I have met combinations like this (illustrating), 
              written deliberately and in cold blood.&#8221;&nbsp; The phrase 
              Mr. Reed gave as an illustration represented, &#8220;I think it 
              was said that there would be such&#8221;&#8212;a phrase-form that 
              required no less than ten downward movements!&nbsp; Mr. Reed then 
              made this significant cormnent: &#8220;It is indeed awkward to have 
              to draw the hand so far downwards and then to make a sudden dash 
              upwards to regain your position on the line!&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their &#8220;Reporter&#8217;s Companion,&#8221; 
              Benn Pitman and Jerome B. Howard make this explicit statement:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Departing widely from 
                the line of writing tends to disturb the even movement of the 
                reporter&#8217;s hand, producing a &#8220;jerk,&#8221; or momentary 
                loss of poise in the effort to regain the line-position. Such 
                a disturbance is dangerous to the writer who is following a rapid 
                speaker, and may, at a critical moment, lead to an actual breakdown 
                in the continuity of the report.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward Pocknell, author 
              of &#8220;Legible Shorthand&#8221; (a geometric system), stated 
              that among the features of &#8220;a good shorthand&#8221; were the 
              following: few people, indeed, realize its importance as a speed 
              factor in shorthand until their attention is called to it. In speaking 
              of it before the Shorthand Society, London, a professional reporter, 
              Mr. Edward Pocknell, author of Pocknell&#8217;s &#8220;Legible Shorthand,&#8221; 
              said: &#8220;One of the greatest difficulties of the shorthand constructor 
              is to find signs that will produce lineal writing without having 
              recourse to contractions and exceptions to rules.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Pocknell was right. In my earlier 
              efforts at shorthand construction some of the outlines shot away 
              towards the top of the notebook, while others seemed determined 
              to reach the bottom of the page.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous familiar expedients suggested 
              themselves&#8212;expedients that tempted me to depart from my ideals&#8212;such 
              as alternative forms for certain letters. I did not succeed in reaching 
              my ideal in those early efforts; but in constructing &#8220;Light-Line,&#8221; 
              I gradually worked towards the solution through the analysis of 
              the frequency of the various letters and particularly, of the various 
              combinations of letters. How this was accomplished will be fully 
              explained when I come to the story of the construction of the alphabet. 
              I believe that an examination of any page of writing in our system 
              will show a very much smaller proportion of words ending below or 
              above the line than in any other system, past or present. If you 
              place a page of the notes alongside a page of notes in any other 
              system, you will notice that in our system a very large percentage 
              of the words and phrases end on the line, so that the hand is in. 
              position. to begin. the next word; whereas in other systems a very 
              large percentage of the forms end beneath the line of writing, and 
              require an upward jump of the hand to get in position for the next 
              word. This involves what has been called &#8220;air travelling,&#8221; 
              that is to say, movements which have no value or significance, as 
              the time consumed in moving from one position to another is absolutely 
              lost so far as practical writing is concerned.&sup1;</p>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sup1; Since this was written 
              the &#8220;Committee on Shorthand Standards&#8221; of the New York 
              State Shorthand Reporters&#8217; Association, 1918, has declared 
              that:<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Assignment of signs to sounds 
              should give a factor of (horizontal) lineality of not less than 
              75 per cent.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report then states:<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;This factor of lineality varies 
              for well-known shorthands from just under 50 per cent for most Pitmanic 
              to just over 90 per cent for Gregg.&#8221;</p></td>

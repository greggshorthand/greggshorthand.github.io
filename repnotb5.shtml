          <td width="79%" colspan="2" class="text"><p align="center"><strong>Notes of Norman C. McKnight (Los Angeles, California)</strong></p>
            <p>Norman McKnight&rsquo;s notes are selected for analysis for more  than one good reason.&nbsp; First of all, he  was a member of the Gregg Clinic Committee; he was one of the fastest writers  of the system, as attested by his work in the national contests; but,  particularly, because his notes are especially interesting and  provocative.&nbsp; They are not the usual Gregg  notes that one sees in the magazines.&nbsp;  Not that they do not possess the same workmanlike  characteristics&mdash;penmanship, mastery of principles, and facility of execution&mdash;of  notes f other good writers.&nbsp; They possess  all those points of quality to a high degree, but still they are not usual  notes.<br /><br />
              
              For McKnight was an experimenter.&nbsp; Every reporter is more or less of an  experimenter, I know, but McKnight&rsquo;s experiments have been of a more free and  untrammelled type, so that his style was an extremely individualistic one.<br /><br />
              
              To begin with, note his first outline &ldquo;judge on the bench.&rdquo;&nbsp; Observe that &ldquo;on the&rdquo; is expressed by  <em>o</em>-anticlockwise <em>th</em>.&nbsp; This is a definite  principle with McKnight, and not an isolated shortcut.&nbsp; He writes <em>o-th-a</em> for &ldquo;on that&rdquo;; <em>o-th-s</em> for &ldquo;on  those&rdquo;; <em>o-th-m</em> for &ldquo;on them&rdquo;; and <em>o-th-s</em> for &ldquo;on this,&rdquo; the <em>s</em> in this last  outline being a continuation of the anti-clockwise <em>th</em>, resembling the final  backward flourish we often give to outlines when we are feeling particularly  good!&nbsp; The outline must be seen really to  appreciate it.&nbsp; All of the <em>th</em>&rsquo;s employed  in this principle are anti-clockwise <em>th</em>&rsquo;s.&nbsp;  The principle consists of omitting the <em>n</em> and using in all instances the  backward rather than the forward <em>th</em>, thus saving one stroke in each of the  phrases.<br /><br />
              
              This single page of notes displays several other unorthodox  but ingenious shortcuts that McKnight worked out with obvious care and  consistency.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;consistency,&rdquo;  because none of them is an isolated expedient&mdash;they are all parts of definite  principles that he has devised for himself.<br /><br />
              
              Note the phrase &ldquo;at the end.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the is expressed in this phrase by a  simple <em>t</em> started below the line of writing. The principle in this respect is to  omit &ldquo;at&rdquo; but to begin the rest of the phrase below the line&mdash;except that he  apparently expressed &ldquo;the&rdquo; by <em>t</em> instead of the standard <em>th</em>.&nbsp; Another illustration of this principle on  this page is &ldquo;at that time.&rdquo;<br /><br />
              
              &ldquo;Counsel table,&rdquo; &ldquo;liquor store,&rdquo; and &ldquo;did you arrive,&rdquo; are  all very good orthodox phrases.<br /><br />
              
              McKnight also carried his experiments to the writing of the  digits.&nbsp; Note how he writes the figure 5  in the first line; the figure 9 in the &ldquo;29th of October&rdquo;; and how he  writes the figure 3, which occurs several times near the end of the page.&nbsp; The figure 5 becomes simply the letter <em>s</em>; and  Swem could, from experience add his testimony to the effectiveness of this  particular shortcut, for he used it for years; and also used a 3 which is in  effect the same as McKnight&rsquo;s.<br /><br />
              
              Note &ldquo;afternoon,&rdquo; expressed by the backward th-n-oo; &ldquo;answer&rdquo;  (n-s above the line), and several other outlines that illustrate the highly  characteristic style of the writer.&nbsp; If  they look strange to you, don&rsquo;t pass them over as badly written outlines, for  they are not.&nbsp; They are deliberately and  skillfully formed that way. In fact, no writer who is not gifted with supreme  hand control could successfully write such an abbreviated style as this.<br /><br />
              
          McKnight&rsquo;s extraordinary control and facility of execution  are readily displayed in some of his more orthodox phrases, such as &ldquo;about what  time did you see him,&rdquo; &ldquo;City and County of Los Angeles,&rdquo; &ldquo;what was the last,&rdquo;  and &ldquo;the people are ready,&rdquo; this last phrase being especially intriguing. &mdash;<em>C.L.S., Edited by  Owen</em></p>

          (The Clerk: Raise your right hand. (Oath.) Your name, please.)<br />
          James Lastro, (s-o-p) a witness produced by and on behalf of the People, having been first duly sworn, testified as follows:</p>
          <p>DIRECT EXAMINATION</p>
          <p>By Miss Meyer:<br />
          Q: Mr. Lastro, do you know the defendant seated at the end of the counsel table?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: I do.<br />
Q: Did you see him on the 29th of October, 1940?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: I did.<br />
          Q: Where did you see him at that time?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: In the entrance to the liquor store there at Washington and Main.<br />
Q: In the entrance of a liquor store?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: It is a liquor store.<br />
Q: That is a place in the City and County of Los Angeles, isn't it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: It is.<br />
Q: About what time did you see him?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: About 3 P.M. in the afternoon.<br />
          Q: What time did you arrive at that place?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: Well, we arrived about 3, and he took the bet about quarter after 3.</p>
          <p>Mr. Schaffer: What was the last answer?<br />
          (The reporter read the answer.)<br />
          We ask the latter portion of that be stricken.

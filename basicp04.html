            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In closing the preceding chapter I said that 
              my next talk would be about &#8220;the most important element of 
              either longhand or shorthand.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That element is the <em>predominance of curve 
              motion</em>. This feature is probably the most radical departure 
              from the older lines of shorthand construction to be found in the 
              system. Curiously enough, its importance has not been fully appreciated 
              by many writers and teachers, although, when the system was first 
              published, many shorthand authors and others interested in the scientific 
              aspect of shorthand recognized it to be an extremely radical step.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>A New Idea.</strong> &#8212; The distinguished 
              French shorthand author and reporter, M. Jean P. A. Martin, of Lyons, 
              wrote me under date of June 24, 1888&#8212;Less than a month after 
              the publication of &#8220;Light-Line Phonography,&#8221; as Gregg 
              Shorthand was then called&#8212;and the very day he received a copy 
              of my first book:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The postman has brought me your book this 
                morning. . . . I can but think well of a system that embodies 
                all the ideas defended by me time and again, and is mainly constructed 
                after the principles laid down by Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an, 
                the real founder of continental shorthand.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is, however, a point that is quite new 
                to me; I mean the predominance given by you to curve motion. Whilst 
                Mr. Clement Gourju in his Semiographie, and Mrs. De Wik Potel 
                in her Dewikagraphie, endeavored to do away with all consonantal 
                curves, whilst <em>nearly</em>, all of us have criticized large 
                curves (I say the large ones, and not the small ones), you have 
                taken an opposite view of the case.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am glad you have, because I have no doubt 
                you will soon produce reporters, and their notes will be of value 
                to shorthand scientists. We shall better be able to form an opinion 
                on the advisability of predominant curve motion in shorthand writing. 
                We shall watch your progress with great interest. We look upon 
                your system as a very valuable experiment. You are the exponent 
                of an idea, and we <span style="font-size: 10px">LOVE</span> <em>ideas</em> 
                when they are carried into actual practice.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shall ever be glad to give my support to 
                men who fight for the supremacy of the sound principles established 
                by Conan de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an. It is not because your shorthand 
                principles are French; it is because they are scientific, and 
                Science knows no borders, no nationalities; it is human.&#8221;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Writing me again on July 30, 1888, M. Martin 
              said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We do everything we can in order to diminish 
                the number of curves in our representation. You do <em>the very 
                reverse</em>: you remove nearly all the straight lines from the 
                consonantal alphabet. The point at issue must be settled through 
                experience, through practice. You now understand why Shorthand 
                Scientists are anxious to see the notes of several Light-Line 
                Phonographers written at a speed of over 120 words a minute. They 
                want to know what will be the effect of the predominant curve 
                motion on a page of shorthand. Of course, there is no question 
                about this or that system; we do not care about systems. Scientifically 
                speaking, we study ideas, principles, and see what results they 
                yield, no matter the alphabet. And I can but repeat what I said 
                before: yours is a new idea. Light-Line Phonography is, in our 
                opinion a very valuable experiment which all persons who are studying 
                the Science of Shorthand cannot fail to watch with great interest.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At this point it may be interesting to quote 
              what I said on this subject in the preface to the first edition 
              of &#8220;Light-Line Phonography,&#8221; in describing the &#8220;main 
              features&#8221; of the system:</p>
            <p align="center">T<span style="font-size: 10px">HE </span>P<span style="font-size: 10px">REDOMINANCE

            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Curves, the prevailing element of ordinary 
                penmanship, being more facile than straight lines, the author 
                has, so far as is compatible with a well-balanced alphabet, assigned 
                to them the representation of the most frequently recurring consonants. 
                In addition to this, the straight characters have been so arranged 
                that the most frequently recurring combinations of letters form 
                an <em>obtuse</em> angle at their point of junction, and such 
                angle not being observed, the letters are allowed to coalesce 
                naturally in the form of a large curve; thus curve motion has 
                its rightful preponderance, the maximum of facility obtainable 
                from this source is secured, and the system is freed from the 
                unnatural zig-zag motion of the ordinary shorthand.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is expressed in somewhat pretentious language&#8212;I 
              was very young then!&#8212;but it shows that recognition of the 
              prevalence of curves in longhand writing was an important factor 
              in the construction of the system.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In my earlier experiments at shorthand construction 
              I followed the beaten path. The result was an <em>angular</em> style 
              of writing&#8212;a truly &#8220;script-geometric style,&#8221; as 
              someone described it. This realization that curvilinear motion was 
              the greatest of all the elements of longhand writing placed me on 
              the path which led to &#8220;Light-Line Phonography&#8221; and it 
              is the feature of the system to which, more than to any other, is 
              due its wonderful success.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Combination Principle.</strong> 
              &#8212; Those who have read the &#8220;Story of Gregg Shorthand&#8221; 
              as told at the Silver Jubilee meetings (and afterwards published 
              in pamphlet form) will remember the emphasis placed upon the discovery 
              of the <em>combination</em> principle, as distinguished from the 
              assignment of characters to the letters in accordance with their 
              <em>individual</em> values. The successful working out of the combination 
              principle depended upon a scientific analysis and utilization of 
              the curvilinear motion of longhand, beginning with the ellipse or 
              oval as a basis.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The assignment of the characters according to 
              <em>individual</em> values in the older systems naturally and inevitably 
              resulted in the straight lines being given the preference, as stated 
              in the letters from M. Jean P. A. Martin, which I have quoted. Straight 
              lines <em>when joined</em>, resulted in a jerky, angular style of 
              writing. Mr. Hugh B. Callendar, B.A., of Cambridge University, put 
              this truth very well when he said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is commonly stated that straight lines 
                are more facile than curves. This is true of a series of straight 
                lines described independently; but the curve often has the advantage 
                in the matter of joining to other characters, for its curvature 
                may generally be varied, especially near the ends, so as to make 
                the joining easier.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. D. P. Lindsley, author of &#8220;Lindsley&#8217;s 
              Takigraphy,&#8221; in writing about &#8220;The Nature of Angles,&#8221; 
              said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the hand is in rapid motion, any change 
                of direction must hinder the speed of the writing. If the first 
                glide into the second without any angle, the highest speed can 
                be secured.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Writing on this subject, another well-known 
              author and teacher, Mr. R. L. Eames, said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has been said that Nature abhors a vacuum; 
                I believe I may add with truth that Nature abhors a straight line. 
                Nowhere in the whole domain of the universe can there be found 
                a single instance of natural motion in a straight line. No system 
                based on this principle (of straight lines) can be easily written, 
                or naturally rapid, but must depend for stenographic capability 
                on extreme brevity.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>An Unusual Review. </strong>&#8212; 
              About a year after the publication of &#8220;Light-Line Phonography&#8221; 
              a review of it appeared in a newspaper in South Africa &#8212; the 
              <em>Cape Argus</em>, Cape Town.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not know who wrote the article, but in 
              the thirty years that have passed since then I have not seen a more 
              satisfactory or penetrating review of the system. The following 
              sentences from it have a direct bearing on the subject of this article 
              &#8212; curve motion:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The inventor hits Pitman in a vulnerable 
                part when he claims &#8220;frequency of curves, and infrequency 
                of angles.&#8221; Awkward angles&#8212;awkward to make and liable 
                to run into incorrect forms&#8212;are unquestionably a weak point 
                in Pitman, because when one set of wrist and forearm muscles are 
                being used these angles demand a sudden jump to another set, which 
                tends as it were, to throw the machinery out of gear. In the system 
                before us the inventor seems to be on the right lines. The great 
                thing in rapid writing is not that the strokes should be as brief 
                and few as possible, but that they should flow with perfect ease 
                and without the slightest hesitation from the pen. Therefore it 
                follows that if there is to be improvement in the shape of characters, 
                it will come in the direction of keeping the lines as much as 
                possible in one direction, choosing lines easily made, and discarding 
                those which tend to check the fingers and call into play a set 
                of muscles different from those ordinarily employed. Mr. Gregg&#8217;s 
                system looked at from this point of view is one which certainly 
                deserves attention from those interested in the subject&#8212;in 
                fact great success is claimed for it already.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone knows that a stiff, angular style 
              of longhand writing always connotes a <em>slow</em> writing, and 
              that an easy, rapid, effortless style of writing abounds in curves, 
              because curves are written with a free, rolling continuous motion. 
              The muscles are relaxed in making elliptical curves; straight lines 
              necessitate greater rigidity of hand. If this be true of longhand, 
              it must be equally true of shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some very significant admissions about the value 
              of curve motion occur in &#8220;Phonography in the Office,&#8221; 
              a book published by Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons. After deploring the 
              tendency of students to write a heavy style of shorthand, the author 
              of the book, Mr. Alfred Kingston, says:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The increased friction from the resistance 
                of the paper makes it a serious obstacle to the acquisition of 
                speed, to say nothing of the difficulty of distinguishing thin 
                and thick strokes.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Kingston then proceeds to give an exercise 
              to be practiced for the purpose of counteracting this heavy style, 
              but he takes care to say:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The exercise is so framed as to consist<em> 
                almost exclusively of light curves</em>. The selection of words 
                and phrases which favor a continuous flowing style of writing 
                will also enable the writer to take it down easily. <em>The rate 
                of speed acquired in the writing of such a passage will be much 
                greater than upon an ordinary passage, and it must not be used 
                as a test of speed, or the result will be very misleading.</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is surprising that Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons 
              permitted that statement to appear in one of their books. But at 
              the time it was published the Pitman firm did not have competition 
              with a system based on &#8220;light curves,&#8221; which yield &#8220;greater 
              speed&#8221; than angular zig-zag writing&#8212;a system free from 
              the &#8220;increased friction&#8221; caused by heavy strokes.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So far, in speaking of curve motion in longhand, 
              I have discussed it mainly from the practical standpoint. The following 
              quotation about &#8220;the beauty of curves,&#8221; from Dr. Francis 
              Wayland was sent to me by one of our writers who thought it applicable 
              to the writing of the system:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Motion in curves is more beautiful than that 
                in straight lines, both because of the greater beauty of the curved 
                line, and because curvilinear motion indicates less effort. For 
                these reasons, the motion of a fish in the water has always seemed 
                to me remarkably beautiful. The waving of a field of grain, presenting 
                an endless succession of curved lines, advancing and receding 
                with gentle motion, uniform in the midst of endless variety, has 
                always seemed to me one of the most beautiful objects in Nature. 
                On the contrary, jolting and angular motion always displeases 
                us. How different is the effect produced by the motion of one 
                man on crutches, and of another on skates.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet there are some people who still adhere 
              to a belief in &#8220;jolting, angular motion,&#8221; as the true 
              basis of shorthand writing!<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the preceding chapter I stated that our system 
              was based on the <em>ellipse</em> or oval, and that this was the 
              vital distinction between it and geometric systems, which are founded 
              on the <em>circle</em> and its segments. Bearing this in mind, you 
              will realize that the ellipse embodies the natural <em>curve motion 
              </em>of the hand in writing. This is the feature which distinguishes 
              our system not only from the geometric systems, but from all other 
              systems that claim to be founded on longhand or on the slope of 
              longhand.*<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My next subject will be an important and original 
              development of curve motion, which came about in a very interesting 
              way.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* As this book is going to press my attention 
              has been called to the results of an investigation made by The National 
              Institute of Industrial Psychology (London), an institution established 
              to promote efficiency in industry. The Institution&#8217; reports 
              the findings of its skilled and trained psychologists after an investigation 
              of the mental and physical qualities of operatives in factories 
              and workshops, as follows:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the shortest distance between two points 
                is a straight line; the investigators have found that curved movements 
                of the hands, though longer than straight movements, may be quicker 
                in the end. .. . Workers were trained by the investigators to 
                follow curved paths and natural rhythms instead of straight lines, 
                and an increase of thirty per cent output was obtained, far less 
                effort resulting.</p>

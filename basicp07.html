              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My contention is that it is not permissible 
                to elaborate distinctions of thickness in one and the same stroke, 
                by making it at one time thinner and at another thicker. Such 
                a contrivance may be placed in its obvious light if we could imagine 
                anyone proposing to abbreviate our ordinary writing by making 
                the &#8220;k&#8221;, when written thick and heavily, to stand 
                for &#8220;g&#8221;, and when thinned to be used for &#8220;k&#8221; 
                or so that &#8220;Kate&#8221; would be written with a thin &#8220;k&#8221; 
                and a thin &#8220;t&#8221;, and &#8220;giddy&#8221; with a thick

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you will have 
              noticed, I have taken pains to show that shorthand principles have 
              gone through a process of evolution. In tracing this process of 
              evolution in shorthand we often find that an expedie.nt, which is 
              introduced in an incidental way in one system, has been expanded 
              into an important basic principle in the structure of a later system, 
              and we often find that when the principle has been applied to the 
              limit of its possibilities there has sometimes come a reaction against 
              it. Thickening of characters as a means of distinction between similar 
              consonant sounds, is a good illustration of this.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As comparatively few people have given much 
              thought to the origin of the expedient of thickening in shorthand, 
              and its effects upon the history of shorthand when extended from 
              an <em>expedient to a principle</em>, I am going to explain it somewhat 
              fully.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Origin of &#8220;Shading.&#8221;</strong> 
              &#8212; The first use of shading to distinguish between pairs of 
              consonants has been generally attributed to the Harding edition 
              of the Taylor system. Harding&#8217;s first edition was published 
              in 1823, and, as will be seen from a quotation given later in this 
              chapter, Isaac Pitman studied shorthand from the Harding edition 
              of the Taylor system and wrote it for seven years. Probably this 
              is why the introduction of shading for the purpose of distinguishing 
              between pairs has been very generally attributed to Harding.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While writing this series of articles 
              I had occasion to refer to Molineux&#8217;s &#8220;Introduction 
              to Byrom&#8217;s Shorthand,&#8221; and in it I found the following 
              sentences:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; The next consonant, 
                it may be observed, is <em>f</em> or <em>v</em>, the latter being 
                in general represented by the same mark as <em>j</em>; though, 
                occasionally, it may be useful to distinguish from the former 
                by making a stroke a <font size="1">LITTLE THICKER</font>.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A similar distinction is also occasionally 
                made, whenever it may appear either useful or necessary, between 
                the letters <em>s</em> and <em>z</em>, which, having the same 
                power, are generally signified by one and the same horizontal 
                straight line. When they are distinguished from each other, the 
                letter <em>z</em> is made a little thicker than the <em>s</em>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">The book from which I have quoted this 
              is the Fifth Edition, published in 1821; but probably the same statement 
              appeared in the previous editions, the first of which was published 
              in 1796. As Harding&#8217;s first edition of Samuel Taylor&#8217;s 
              system was published in 1823, it seems clear that he derived this 
              means of distinction between pairs from Molineux or Byrom&#8212;especially 
              as the distinction is made for the same pairs&#8212;<em>f</em> and 
              <em>v</em>; <em>s</em> and <em>z</em>&#8212;as in Molineux&#8217;s 
              edition of Byrom&#8217;s system.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his &#8220;History of Shorthand&#8221; Isaac 
              Pitman quotes approvingly from the review of Byrom&#8217;s system 
              by Lewis, in which he says:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
                order to assist the learner he [Byrom] classifies the letters 
                in the following manner, according to their affinity of sound 
                or their labial connection: <br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>p, b; f, v; s, z; sh, zh; t, d; th, dh; 
                k, g; ch, j; m, n; l, r; h</em>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Isaac Pitman, having 
              been familiar with this method of using shading as a means of distinguishing 
              between some of the cognates through his practice of Harding&#8217;s 
              edition of the Taylor system, expanded it to a general principle 
              for the purpose of distinguishing all phonetic pairs of letters.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>A Retrograde Step.</strong> &#8212; 
              I regard it as extremely unfortunate for the progress of shorthand 
              that Isaac Pitman studied the Harding edition of the Taylor system. 
              If he had not done so, the history of shorthand for more than half 
              a century might have been entirely different, and the art might 
              now be part of the education of every child. Think what that would 
              have meant to the world! The saving in time and effort effected 
              for millions of people, to say nothing of the educational advantages 
              that would have been derived by all who studied the subject, simply 
              staggers the imagination.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; By the extension of thickening to nearly all the phonetic 
              pairs as a means of distinction, the progress of the art was deflected 
              from its natural course for more than half a century. I say this 
              because I am thoroughly convinced that the real source of most of 
              the &#8220;complexities, perplexities, and eccentricities&#8221; 
              of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, which have prevented it from becoming 
              almost universal, is to be found in the introduction of shading 
              to distinguish the phonetic pairs. I hope to make this so clear 
              as to carry conviction to the mind of the impartial reader.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To begin, then, at the very beginning: &#8220;The 
              Life of Sir Isaac Pitman,&#8221; published by Isaac Pitman &amp; 
              Sons, says:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Phonography, 
                he long afterwards wrote, with all the intellectual and social 
                benefits that follow in its train, has resulted from the seemingly 
                trifling circumstance that the author, at the age of seventeen, 
                learned Taylor&#8217;s system of shorthand from Harding&#8217;s 
                edition and that he was incited to the study chiefly by the persual 
                of the eloquent enumeration of some of the advantages arising 
                from the practice of the art, from the pen of Mr. Gawtress, the 
                publisher of an improved edition of Byrom&#8217;s system.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Andrew J. Graham, 
              author of the &#8220;Graham Standard Phonography,&#8221; in the 
              Phonographic World for August, 1889, pointed out that the use of 
              shading, as a means of distinction between the phonetic pairs of 
              letters, was suggested by Mr. Pitman&#8217;s previous use of the 
              Harding edition of the Taylor system. Mr. Graham said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Isaac Pitman, 
                by his own acknowledgment, used Taylor&#8217;s system for seven 
                years prior to the publication of his &#8220;Stenographic Sound 
                Hand.&#8221; Taylor&#8217;s system was published in 1786, and 
                in 1823 there was published an improvement upon it by Harding 
                and it is my impression that Isaac Pit-man acknowledges in some 
                of his works that that was the system he used for seven years. 
                Although Mr. Pitman has never made any acknowledgment of his indebtedness 
                to Harding for the most important principles of &#8220;Phonography,&#8221; 
                we find in his 1837 edition that he copied the most important 
                of these from Harding&#8217;s book; and these were. the method 
                of representing vowels by dots and dashes and of distinguishing 
                pairs of letters by pairs of light and heavy signs, as <em>f</em>, 
                <em>v</em>; <em>s</em>, <em>z</em>. (Pitman&#8217;s Phonotypic 
                Journal, Vol. VI., 1847, p. 340). Mr. Pitman publicly acknowledged 
                that to one familiar with these representations of this idea it 
                was but child&#8217;s play, with the relations of the consonants 
                of the language generally known, to <em>apply this</em> important 
                principle in his alphabet; as, in the &#8220;First Edition&#8221; 
                (1837), <em>p, b, t, d, ch, j, k, g, f, v, s, z</em>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; [Mr. Graham then gave 
              shorthand illustrations showing how closely Mr. Pitman followed 
              Harding in the arrangement of the consonants in his 1837 edition.]</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fine, Isaac 
                Pitman in 1837 copied Harding&#8217;s alphabet, with its important 
                characteristics, more closely than he has his own 1837 alphabet, 
                in several editions since.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, Mr. Pitman appropriated from Harding 
                the plan of writing words in <em>three</em> different positions, 
                to imply first-position, second-position, or third-position vowels. 
                See Harding&#8217;s book (1830) p. 24, last paragraph but one. 
                Also Harding&#8217;s plan of writing the vowels to preceding or 
                following consonants and the plan of reckoning the position from 
                the beginning or direction of the consonant.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">Mr. Graham then states that Isaac Pitman 
              was indebted to Harding for:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Similar or paired signs for similar or paired 
                sounds. As to discovering these relations of the consonants they 
                were completely known to phonologists from 1787 (in Rev. William 
                Graham&#8217;s Shorthand, in Byrom&#8217;s system, and in<br />
                Harding&#8217;s).<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. The arrangement of vowels into two classes, 
                one part represented by dots, and the other by dashes, in three 
                different places, with a determination of the order in which those 
                vowels were to be placed, to read before or after; and as to the 
                direction of the strokes.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Graham&#8217;s 
              article is interesting, although it is marred by personal malevolence 
              towards the author of Phonography.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Phonetic Pairing Very Old</strong>. 
              &#8212; As emphasis is placed in the foregoing quotation on the 
              pairing of sounds, we may point out that Mr. Graham could have quoted 
              earlier instances of pairing than those he mentioned. The following 
              quotation from &#8220;The Life and Labors of Sir Isaac Pit-man,&#8221; 
              by Benn Pitman, is valuable in this connection:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is a curious 
                incident in Stenographic history, that the exact order of Isaac 
                Pitman&#8217;s simple-vowel scheme, and <em>to a great extent 
                the pairing of the consonants</em>, was anticipated in one system 
                of Shorthand, namely, that by Holdsworth and Aldridge, joint authors 
                of &#8220;Natural Shorthand,&#8221; published in 1766. . . . It 
                was the first brief system of writing in which the phonetic principle 
                and a full alphabet were recognized.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In extending Harding&#8217;s 
              expedient to all the pairs Mr. Pitman found it necessary to give 
              the downward directions to nearly all the frequent pairs of letters, 
              since shading could not be applied with ease or certainty to upstrokes. 
              Therefore Mr. Pitman assigned downward characters to some of the 
              most common pairs of letters&#8212;<em>t, d, p, b, f, v, s, z, sh, 
              zh, th, dh, r, l</em>. This resulted in a constant downward tendency 
              in the writing, and to counteract this preponderating downward tendency 
              Mr. Pitman provided some of the letters with alternative forms which 
              were written upwards. In the introduction of these alternative forms 
              to patch up a defect in the arrangement of the alphabet&#8212;a 
              defect which was a direct outcome of the use of shading to distinguish 
              similar consonants&#8212;is to be found the origin of most of the 
              complications of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Evil Effects of &#8220;Shading.&#8221;</strong> 
              &#8212; To return to the arrangement of the Pitman alphabet: The 
              upward straight line was assigned to <em>r</em> (only one form of 
              <em>r</em>), one upward curve to <em>l</em> (only one form of <em>l</em>), 
              the other upward curve to <em>sh</em> (only one form of <em>sh</em>); 
              the horizontal straight facile line was assigned to comparatively 
              infrequent <em>k</em>, <em>g</em>; and the horizontal curves to 
              <em>n, ng, m, mp</em>. Just compare the importance of these letters, 
              and you will see at once that &#8220;stenographic balance&#8221; 
              (or lineal writing) is absolutely impossible when so many frequently-occurring 
              letters are written downwards. Remember, too, that <em>t, d, p, 
              b, s, z, th,</em> are <font size="1">ALWAYS</font> written in a 
              downward direction and that the three upward characters, <em>r</em>, 
              <em>l</em>, <em>sh</em>, are as often written downward as upward, 
              and you will get an idea of what I meant about the evil effects 
              that the introduction of shading had upon shorthand construction.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his &#8220;Note-Taker&#8221; (published in 
              1873) D. P. Lindsley pointed out that in Pitmanic Shorthand it was 
              possible to writes the combination <em>strd</em> in <em>twenty ways</em>. 
              He said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; It is not easy to employ 
                the best form for a word when several possible forms occur to 
                the mind. For example, suppose that a word containing the letters 
                s t r d is to be written. The form may be varied in more than 
                a dozen ways, retaining the letters in the same order. In the 
                following words, the only consonants written by the Phonographers 
                are s t r d; yet each word is written in a different way, as follows: 
                Then followed the outlines for these words: <em>Saturday</em>, 
                <em>steward</em>, <em>stride</em>, <em>strayed</em>, <em>astrayed</em>, 
                <em>astride</em>, <em>eastward</em>, <em>yesterday</em>, <em>sturdy</em>, 
                <em>stirred</em>, <em>storied</em>, <em>star-eyed</em>, <em>asteroid</em>.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Were the forms given above all the forms from 
                which the student must choose in writing words containing these 
                letters, the difficulty would not be so great as it really is; 
                for, besides these legitimate outlines there are <em>eight</em> 
                others, which are not recommended for use, yet are quite as likely 
                to be chosen by the young writer, who must choose between twenty 
                possible outlines to find the correct one.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the above was written the 
              &#8220;Committee on Shorthand Standards&#8221; of the New York State 
              Shorthand Reporters&#8217; Association has declared that the &#8220;compound 
              consonant devices of Pitmanic shorthand contribute not a little 
              to its weakness through being pushed too far.&#8221; Says the committee:<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;This factor more than any other is lost 
              sight of by the writer of mature experience. To realize its importance 
              you must by a conscious effort set aside the unconscious familiarity 
              acquired by thorough training and long experience and look with 
              the open mind and inquiring eye of the shorthand novice about to 
              be initiated into the mysteries of the shorthand art.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;Consider these eight signs, with their 
              respective meanings:</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/basicp001.gif" alt="s, thr, z, dhr, r, fr, w, vr" width="336" height="54" /><br />
              *The Benn Pitman form for <em>W</em> is used.</p>
            <p align="left" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No 
              explanation however ingenious can evade the confusion of the student 
              on learning that a stem which, through every other variation of 
              half or double length, final hooks, loops, or circles, is consistently 
              S or some systematic addition to 5, here stands for the S-less compound 
              <em>thr</em>&#8212;and similarly for the other three pairs of stems.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;Consider the consonant sequence <em>str</em></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/basicp002.gif" width="233" height="106" /> 
            </p>
            <p align="left" style="text-align: justify">Here are twelve different 
              representations provided, of which every writer will use at least 
              a majority at one time or another. By any standard of the relative 
              frequency of the combination or of the component sounds this is 
              an overbalanced and wasteful use of material, contributing more 
              to mental hesitation than to facility.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;Consider, for a final illustration, the 
              double length device used for <em>te</em>; <em>der</em>, and <em>ther</em> 
              on all strokes, for <em>ker</em>, <em>ger</em>, and <em>er</em>, 
              in addition on some strokes, with a sentiment rapidly crystallizing 
              in favor of using it for ted on all strokes as well. In professional 
              shorthand writing almost any device or sign may or must be expected 
              to &#8216;carry double,&#8217; but reasonable limitations must be 
              observed if positive legibility, the final test of any system, style 
              or writer, is to be maintained.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Experienced writers of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand 
              frankly admit that the numerous alternative forms for letters in 
              that system are a fruitful source of hesitancy and uncertainty in 
              writing. Few of them, I believe, have traced the necessity for these 
              alternatives to the original source&#8212;the introduction of shading 
              to distinguish the phonetic pairs. This defect in the system has 
              been so well recognized by the Pitman firm that there has been a 
              strenuous effort to create a feeling of reverence f or these alternatives 
              as perfect marvels of scientific ingenuity. A favorite method of 
              camouflage is to speak of the &#8220;wealth of material&#8221; represented 
              by these alternatives.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Alternatives Responsible for &#8220;Breakdowns.&#8221;</strong> 
              &#8212; As illustrations of the amusing manner in which the publishers 
              of Isaac Pitman Shorthand seek to defend the use of alternative 
              signs for the characters, I give two quotations. The first is from 
              an article on &#8220;Alternatives in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand,&#8221; 
              which appeared in Pitman&#8217;s Journal for July 26, 1919:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the features that conspicuously distinguish 
                Pit-man&#8217;s Shorthand from inferior systems is the provision 
                of alternative forms for the representation of individual consonants. 
                . . . Failure to grasp or to recognize the full significance of 
                the rules which govern the employment of various alternatives 
                is responsible for many an examination breakdown. It cannot be 
                too often repeated that it is wise on the part of every student, 
                when he or she has gone through the adopted text-book or attended 
                a complete course of instruction, to go through the system again 
                from the beginning. The early rules will now be seen in the new 
                light. Little things that had been overlooked or imperfectly mastered 
                will reveal their real importance, which was perhaps less obvious 
                on the first persual. The great value of the alternative forms 
                would be brought out by a critical scrutiny such as is here recommended. 
                And the necessity of availing oneself fully of those alternatives 
                will be driven home with a force that was not felt originally. 
                . .<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let the intelligent, critical student ask 
                himself why it proves beneficial in practice to use sometimes 
                a stroke and sometimes a circle to represent s; why it is useful 
                to be able in some instances to write r or sh from the bottom 
                upwards and in other instances to write those letters from the 
                top downwards; why it is valuable to indicate an added t or d 
                by halving, and why in certain cases it is preferable to employ 
                the full-stroke forms to represent those letters; or how it is 
                that legibility and fluency are promoted by the use of hooks for 
                <em>r</em>, <em>l</em>, <em>f</em>, and <em>v</em>, in addition 
                to the alphabetic characters; or what is the precise gain secured 
                by the various modes of representing the aspirate, and he will 
                soon find that he is launched on a fruitful intellectual inquiry. 
                He will be brought into close and intimate contact with some striking 
                facts of the language and of the raw material from which<br />
                all shorthand writing is built up.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&#8220;Facing Facts.&#8221;</strong> 
              &#8212; The same journal for September 17, 1921, which I have just 
              received, contains an article under the title, &#8220;Pitman&#8217;s 
              Shorthand and its Facile Word-Forms,&#8221; which I give in full:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The student of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, 
                when he has discovered how efficaciously the use of alternative 
                characters to represent a single consonant serves the purpose 
                of vowel indication, is prone to apply the method universally. 
                To be able from the mere form of a consonant character to tell 
                infallibly whether an unwritten vowel precedes or follows it, 
                or whether a vowel is or is not to be read between two successive 
                consonants, comes as a revelation of hitherto unsuspected possibility 
                of handwriting. The beginner had encountered nothing like it in 
                learning shorthand. And he is justifiably fascinated. He has found 
                out for the first time how to make two blades of grass grow where 
                one grew before. His enthusiasm is diverted into a new channel 
                when his teacher begins to invite his serious attention to another 
                powerful tendency in this system. Alternative signs, he begins 
                to perceive, serve another purpose also. Shorthand is not merely 
                a method of brief writing. It is a method of rapid writing. The 
                twin requirements of legibility and speed have to be provided 
                for; and since all posmble combinations of geometric forms are 
                not equally capable of being made with perfect accuracy at speed, 
                there are instances in which it becomes imperative to select the 
                form that does fulfil that requirement. Ease of writing then becomes 
                the paramount consideration. And so the student having learnt, 
                for instance, that a downward <em>r</em> indicates a preceding 
                vowel and that an upward <em>r</em> indicates that a vowel follows, 
                is made aware that another indispensable need compels him sometimes 
                to subordinate the principle of vowel-indication to that of facility 
                of writing. The upward <em>r</em> in <em>arch</em>, <em>artist</em>, 
                <em>answer</em> and <em>officer</em>, and the downward <em>r</em> 
                in <em>room</em>, <em>remain</em>, and <em>romance</em>, show 
                how Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand faces facts.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any intelligent 
              reader will know why the Pitman publishers feel it so necessary 
              to assume an attitude of profound admiration for alternative characters, 
              and to go into ecstasies over the manner in which their system &#8220;faces 
              facts.&#8221; The truth is that it is because they are face to face 
              with facts that such articles appear in almost every number of their 
              publications.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The consequence of the introduction of shading, 
              to distinguish the common phonetic pairs, is that instead of having 
              a fluent, onward, lineal movement the tendency of the Pitman writing 
              is invariably downward. It is almost impossible to write any long 
              word in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand from the alphabet without the writing 
              descending two, three, and sometimes four strokes, below the line 
              of writing. This explains why all the early lessons in Pitman&#8217;s 
              Shorthand consist almost exclusively of monosyllables. <em>Very 
              few long words are ever written from the alphabet in Pitmanic shorthand.</em><br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Alternative Forms a Hindrance.</strong> 
              &#8212; Writing on this subject in the <em>Gregg Shorthand Magazine</em> 
              for November, 1914, Mr. E. P. Aust (of Bath) said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But whatever passage is chosen, the alphabetic 
                character of Gregg will always stand out as one of its strongest 
                features.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It must be a very common experience of Pitman 
                teachers, after explaining to and drilling their students in one 
                of the many modifications of the Pitman alphabet, each with its 
                numerous rules and exceptions, to find them continuing to write 
                alphabetically. The average student, when he has to write a new 
                word, writes it alphabetically, and generally lets it stay at 
                that. And if the case of the reporter (recently quoted by you) 
                who wrote <em>reference</em> in full, is at all typical, this 
                sort of thing is not confined to learners. In the case of the 
                learner, at any rate, I think it is a perfectly natural and logical 
                error. The Gregg student will, of course, act in precisely the 
                same way, save that he will use the vowels as well; but generally, 
                unlike the case of the Pitman learner, the resulting outline will 
                be correct, or nearly so. I went into my Gregg class the other 
                day, and found them trying&#8212; they were all beginners&#8212;to 
                write their names in Gregg. There were some, of course, who had 
                not gone far enough to do this, but quite a number of the students 
                succeeded. They had simply used their alphabet.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within the past 
              week I received a letter from a gentleman in England who is known 
              to shorthand teachers everywhere as a foremost authority on Pitman&#8217;s 
              Shorthand, but whose name I cannot give without his permission. 
              Among other things he said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After giving this time to Gregg Shorthand 
                and understanding something of its structure and beauty&#8212;you 
                do well to speak of Gregg artists&#8212;I find that the angular 
                outlines of Pitman are positively repellent-&#8212;they offend 
                my artistic eye. Certainly you have a very beautiful system, compared 
                with which Pitman is cold and dead.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That paragraph 
              would have gone in the first chapter had I received it in time. 
              The next paragraph has a more direct bearing on the point discussed 
              by Mr. Aust:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great asset 
                of Gregg, apart from its fluent, script characteristic, is to 
                my mind, that a very wide vocabulary is available early; there 
                is more shorthand material in the first seven lessons of your 
                Manual than in the whole of the Pitman Manual.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Another 
              Evil of Shading.</strong> &#8212; Among my correspondents many years 
              ago was a talented and experienced journalist who had used Pitman&#8217;s 
              Shorthand for more than thirty years as a reporter. The gentleman 
              to whom I refer, Mr. J. L. Cobbin, of Cape Town, South Africa, had 
              published an improvement on Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand under the title, 
              &#8220;The Student&#8217;s Shorthand&#8221;; and papers from his 
              pen were read and discussed with great interest at the meetings 
              of the famous &#8220;Shorthand Society,&#8221; of London. Some of 
              the American shorthand publications of that time also gave considerable 
              space to his views on shorthand matters.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is not known to the profession that shortly 
              before his death Mr. Cobbin became intensely interested in our system, 
              and sent me many warm commendations of it&#8212;interspersed, I 
              must admit, with pleas for the retention of certain Pitmanic features 
              to which long habit had accustomed him. His letters contained many 
              acute and philosophic reflections about shorthand systems and shorthand 
              principles. Among other things, he said: &#8220;Your shorthand, 
              I can plainly see, will endure a great amount of scribbling without 
              becoming illegible. This is a high recommendation, evident at a 
              glance to any practical shorthand writer&#8212;the mere amateur 
              &#8216;s opinion I consider as utterly valueless.&#8221; He then 
              went on to say:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The very worst 
              fault in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand is caused by an insufficient provision 
              being made for re-duplicating certain consonants, such as <em>t</em>, 
              <em>d</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>g</em>, <em>ch</em>, 
              <em>j</em>, and compelling the writer either to make a double-length 
              stroke thick in one half and thin in the other or vice versa, or 
              to sacrifice phonetic propriety by substituting one letter for another 
              or making the whole line of one thickness. Such outlines, for instance, 
              as <em>pb</em>, <em>bp</em>, <em>td</em>, <em>dt</em>, <em>kg</em>, 
              <em>chj</em>, <em>jch</em>, are intolerable; and yet there are many 
              words in which they must be written in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand. 
              Happily your shorthand abhors such monstrosities.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Incessant Changes Due to Shading.</strong> 
              &#8212; If you trace the many changes that have been made in the 
              Isaac Pitman system&#8212;averaging an important change for every 
              three years of its existence, as has been shown by Dr. William D. 
              Bridge&#8212;you will find that most of them are due to an effort 
              to keep the writing to the line. This is true also of many of the 
              reporting contractions that have been adopted.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To remedy the fundamental defects in the system 
              Isaac Pitman built up a supplementary alphabet of alternative forms. 
              The result is that <em>r</em> can be written in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand 
              in three different ways: an upward stroke, a downward stroke, and 
              a hook; <em>l</em> also has three characters; <em>sh</em> can be 
              written in two ways&#8212;upward or downward; the unimportant <em>h</em> 
              has four characters (and two of these are compound characters); 
              <em>s</em> has two characters; <em>t</em> and <em>d</em> can each 
              be expressed in two ways, and so can <em>f</em>, <em>v</em>, and 
              <em>n</em>; while <em>w</em> and <em>y</em>, in addition to the 
              signs used to represent them (compound signs, too), can each be 
              prefixed to other letters in six different ways!<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Other Evils Follow</strong>. &#8212; 
              On account of the insertion of the vowels it is not necessary in 
              our system to have special signs for w and y, but in the Pitman 
              scheme not only are separate&#8212;and compound signs&#8212;assigned 
              to these letters, but as these are inadequate, a clumsy expedient 
              is introduced by which w and y are each prefixed to vowels in six 
              different ways!<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking of the absurdity of expressing the 
              aspirate (which Mr. Pitman described as &#8220;<em>a mere breathing</em>&#8221;) 
              in four different ways&#8212;by two <em>compound</em> characters, 
              a tick and a dot&#8212;this na&iuml;ve passage in Pitman&#8217;s 
              Handbook for Shorthand Teachers will be read with amusement by many 
              of our readers:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The very wealth 
                of Phonography is sometimes the cause of perplexity to beginners. 
                They are so accustomed to writing a letter in longhand always 
                the same way that when they discover that the aspirate may be 
                written in Phonography in four ways, they do not readily grasp 
                the idea.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have mentioned 
              twelve letters which are represented in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand 
              by no less than thirty-six characters or expedients. In view of 
              this profusion of alternatives it is more than surprising that Isaac 
              Pitman, in criticizing the system of Samuel Taylor, should say:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two forms should 
                never be given to one letter except from manifest necessity, and 
                such necessity should be avoided as much as possible in the construction 
                of the system; because, with respect to every word containing 
                any such letter it becomes necessary to determine by practice 
                which of the several forms of the letter is most judicious in 
                that particular word. Though this is an advantage in giving a 
                variety of outlines to the words, yet when the principle is extended 
                to a great many letters, the toil is greater than the reward.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The views of the 
              author of Phonography on this subject will be approved by every 
              experienced shorthand writer. And it embodies the strongest of all 
              arguments against Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His brother, Benn Pitman, in his &#8220;Manual 
              of Phonography,&#8221; Par. 239-240, in speaking of outline formation, 
              said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since <em>p, 
                b, t, d, f, v, s, z, sh, zh, l, r, n, w, y,</em> and <em>h</em> 
                are represented in Phonography in more than one way, it is obvious 
                that many words may be written with several possible outlines. 
                The word abbreviation, for instance, has no less than twenty possible 
                f onus, though, of course, only a few of them are at all practical.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The difficulty of choosing the best from among 
                various possible outlines causes, perhaps, more embarrassment 
                to the average student of Phonography than any other one point, 
                and is best overcome by repeatedly reading and copying printed 
                phonographic publications, and by consulting the Phonographic 
                Dictionary, when a doubt arises, while writing original matter.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&#8220;Waste 
              of Material.&#8221;</strong> &#8212; When you hear anyone repeat, 
              parrot-like, something about the &#8220;wealth of material&#8221; 
              in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, or assert that there is a &#8220;waste 
              of material&#8221; in systems written with the slope of longhand, 
              just point to the awful waste of material involved in providing 
              twelve consonants with thirty-six methods of representation!<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The selection, by Mr. Pitman, of the vertical 
              stroke to express t and its cognate, d, was particularly unfortunate. 
              As t is one of the three most common consonants in the language, 
              its expression by a vertical stroke gave a downward tendency to 
              the writing, as anyone can easily ascertain by an examination of 
              a page of Pitman writing. In an effort to remedy this, there was 
              introduced what I consider to be the most illogical device to be 
              found in any system of shorthand &#8212; the half-length expedient. 
              For the information of those who have not studied Pitman&#8217;s 
              Shorthand it may be well to explain that in the Pitman system when 
              a letter is written half its usual length it is supposed to add 
              t or d. As someone expressed it, you &#8220;subtract to multiply.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&#8220;Multiplication by Subtraction.&#8221;</strong> 
              &#8212; Consider what this means. Manifestly a single letter is 
              vastly more frequent than any combination of it with another letter; 
              thus, the letter <em>p</em> probably occurs fifty or one hundred 
              times where <em>pt</em> occurs once. Yet by the halving expedient 
              the <em>shorter sign is assigned to the combination</em> and not 
              to the <em>single letter</em>.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the standpoint of logic, the halving expedient 
              is absolutely indefensible. It is merely an attempt to patch up 
              an organic defect in the construction of the alphabet. But towards 
              it, too, there has been a consistent effort to create a spirit of 
              reverence. Anything that is abstruse and long established is accepted 
              by many people without question when it is called &#8220;scientific&#8221;!<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the Phonographic World for February, 1891, 
              Mr. Justin Gilbert, official reporter, Boise City, Idaho, advises 
              the shorthand author &#8220;to look well to it that each principle 
              in his system is applied in such a manner as to afford the greatest 
              possible benefit to the reporter and amanuensis. That the principle 
              of halving to add t or d is NOT SO applied is evident, as will be 
              seen at even a casual glance. The principle as it is now used is 
              a very useful one, of course, but if applied in another direction 
              it would be made more than five times as useful.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A very talented Isaac Pitman reporter, Mr. George 
              Far-nell, in a paper on &#8220;The Struggle for Existence in Shorthand 
              Material,&#8221; which was read before the New England Shorthand 
              Reporters&#8217; Association in 1900, said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The halving of a letter was an old and well-tried 
                expedient long before Mr. Pitman&#8217;s time, but theretofore 
                had not been made use of for the purpose of addition.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With an alphabet such as just referred to, 
                the phonographer is enabled to violate, with impunity, a fundamental 
                rule of mathematics, and add to the meaning of a character by 
                taking away something from it; in other words, to perpetuate the 
                paradox of making addition by subtraction.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The admission that 
              the halving principle &#8220;violates a fundamental rule of mathematics&#8221; 
              is hardly consistent with the claim that Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand 
              is the embodiment of &#8220;Nature, Science, and History!&#8221; 
              Mr. Farnell, however, is more philosophic and decidedly more candid 
              than most Pitmanic advocates, for he ends his paper with these words:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While, personally, I cannot think that better 
                systems are not possible, yet I admit to the weakness that I would 
                leave the discovery of better systems to others, being content 
                with present shortcomings, if there are any, rather than fly to 
                others that I know not of.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I repeat that the 
              use of all these alternatives is the source of a very large percentage 
              of the complication and indefiniteness of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand. 
              Had the alphabet been selected without the necessity of striking 
              the most common pairs downward&#8212;<em>a necessity due to the 
              introduction of shading</em>&#8212;there would have been no need 
              of all these alternatives, and therefore no need for the innumerable 
              rules, and exceptions to rules, that abound in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because our system, like longhand, is free from 
              compulsory shading, it can be written with greater freedom and with 
              greater speed than any of the shaded systems. And, to a great extent, 
              its remarkable legibility is due to the absence of many of the fine 
              distinctions required by any system in which shading is applied 
              for any purpose.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before leaving this part of the subject it may 
              be well to point out that the loss of time caused by shading is 
              not due entirely to the process of thickening the characters. There 
              are two other causes of loss of time: one is the extreme difficulty 
              of executing <em>in rapid succession</em> light and heavy characters; 
              and the other is the slight (but perceptible) pause which must necessarily 
              take place after each shaded character. The greater freedom of mind 
              and hand secured through the elimination of the necessity for observing 
              different degrees of pressure will be apparent to any one.<br />
              Mr. Thomas AlIen Reed, in discussing brevity of outline, once said: 
              &#8220;There are inflections and inflections. Twenty easy inflections 
              may be written more rapidly than a dozen difficult ones with awkward 
              joinings. The easy flow of a system is one of its more practical 
              elements.&#8221; That is an opinion that will be endorsed by every 
              experienced reporter; and there is nothing that contributes more 
              to the &#8220;easy flow&#8221; of the writing than the elimination 
              of thickened characters.</p>

              the Pre-Anniversary Gregg Shorthands<br />
              </strong><em>First, second, third, fourth, and fifth editions</em><br />
              (1888-1928)</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gregg's Light-Line Phonography was published 
              in 1888 in two small pamphlets. Understandably, Gregg Shorthand 
              was in a very primal state. &nbsp;It contained almost no brief forms 
              and was rather jagged in appearance, looking nothing like the modern 
              cursive forms. &nbsp;The plates were written by Gregg, himself.&nbsp; 
              It was published out of Liverpool, England.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second edition was published 
              in 1893 in Boston.&nbsp; The shorthand plates were also written 
              by Gregg, himself.&nbsp; Five years afterward, a much better version 
              of the system was created and published under the title of &quot;Gregg 
              Shorthand.&quot; This third edition was put into book form in 1897 
              and finally published in 1898.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth edition of Gregg Shorthand 
              was published in 1902.&nbsp; Gregg also wrote these plates.&nbsp; 
              The book was published in Chicago.&nbsp; The book is commonly seen 
              on online auctions, with gold print on the dark front cover.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fifth edition is what is commonly referred 
              to as &quot;Pre-Anniversary&quot;. &nbsp;This was the 1916 edition 
              of Gregg Shorthand. &nbsp;The organization of the 1916 edition was 
              very simple, consisting of twenty lessons. &nbsp;The brief forms 
              were referred to as <em>word-signs</em> and they were grouped with 
              the phrases.&nbsp; The shorthand plates for this book and its supplements 
              were written by Mrs. Hubert A. Hagar.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fifth edition had the most abbreviations 
              and brief forms of any edition of Gregg Shorthand. &nbsp;Notable 
              forms were above (<em>a b oo</em>), after (<em>a f</em>), behalf 
              (<em>b f</em>), check (<em>ch k</em>), man (<em>m n</em>), men (<em>men</em>), 
              principal (<em>p r</em>), season (<em>ses n</em>), teach (<em>t 
              ch</em>), upon (<em>p n</em>), usually (<em>oo sh</em>), vowel (<em>v 
              l</em>, with the angle between the letters distinct). &nbsp;The 
              system was very free, though, working from principles more so than 
              from memorised forms. &nbsp;There were several disjoined word beginnings 
              that existed according to the &quot;tr principle&quot; like <em>alter-</em> 
              (<em>o</em> turned sideways), <em>ultra</em>- (<em>oo</em> turned 
              sideways), <em>later-</em> (<em>l a</em> over the line), <em>letr</em>- 
              or <em>liter-</em> (<em>l i</em> over the line), <em>matri</em>- 
              or <em>mater-</em> (<em>m a</em> over the line), <em>nitr</em>- 
              (<em>n &#299;</em> over the line), <em>nutr-</em> or <em>neutr-</em> 
              (<em>n u</em> over the line), <em>patr-</em> or <em>pater</em>- 
              (<em>p a</em> over the line), <em>petr</em>- (<em>p e</em> over 
              the line), <em>austr-</em> or <em>ostr-</em> (<em>o s</em> over 
              the line), <em>abstr</em>- (<em>a b s</em> over the line), and <em>obstr</em>- 
              (<em>o b s</em> over the line). Hydra- is notated with <em>&#299;</em> 
              over the rest of the word. &nbsp;-<em>Itis</em>, -<em>ntic</em>, 
              -<em>vity</em>, -<em>ness</em> were notated with a disjoined <em>t 
              s</em>, a disjoined <em>n</em>, a disjoined <em>v</em>, and a joined 
              <em>n</em>, respectively.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fascinating word principles were set forth 
              in this edition. &nbsp;The modification of the <em>-ing</em> dot 
              into the next word was introduced (and last seen) here. &nbsp;An 
              example of the indication of &quot;Ing&quot; is <em>doing the</em>, 
              which would be written <em>d u [over th]</em>, with the <em>th</em> 
              where the <em>-ing</em> dot should be. &nbsp;Words could be omitted 
              and placed differently to notate these omissions. &nbsp;<em>Of the</em> 
              was omitted and the words around the omission were placed closer 
              together. &nbsp;<em>From</em> and <em>to</em> are omitted in such 
              phrases as <em>from time to time</em>, and written in one word, 
              which would be written <em>temtem</em> in one outline. &nbsp;<em>By</em> 
              was omitted by making the next word begin under the word before 
              it. &nbsp;<em>Time after time</em> was just <em>time</em> and <em>time</em> 
              written closely together.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This system had a method of notating the [x] 
              sound like the <em>ch</em> in German and Scotch, the <em>gh</em> 
              in Irish Gaelic, and the <em>ll</em> in Welsh. &nbsp;An <em>h</em> 
              dot was placed over the k, g, and l, respectively. &nbsp;Pre-Anniversary 
              made the first use of the breve placed below outlines. &nbsp;To 
              connect words of awkward or impossible joinings like <em>Lehigh</em>, 
              <em>ayah</em>, <em>yahoo</em>, etc., the breve (a small and shallow 
              marking resembling the <em>r</em> curve) was placed between the 
              outlines. &nbsp;This marking was made to distinguish if a vowel 
              needed to be notated as short (since there is no vowel marking for 
              short vowels). &nbsp;The breve was placed underneath the vowel. 
              &nbsp;This was a useful mark for notating words like <em>onion</em>, 
              <em>immigrate</em>, <em>minion</em>, etc.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This version of shorthand was likely the hardest 
              to learn, but it served the reporter very well. &nbsp;The Pre-Anniversary 
              Gregg Shorthands are not commonly seen in literature, but if any 
              Gregg literature dates before 1929, it is written in this series.

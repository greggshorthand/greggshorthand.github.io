            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8230;you would have to 
              find from the evidence that the little boy was free from contributory 
              negligence on his part and, as I said to you at the beginning&#8212;that 
              would depend what a child of his age and experience would do under 
              the circumstances.&nbsp; Now was there an opportunity for the boy 
              to have avoided the danger; had this truck made its turn so far 
              down there that the reasonable careful and prudent child of that 
              age should have seen it, and under those circumstances would he 
              have been able to avoid the accident?<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, gentlemen, the neglect here was 
              solely that of the defendant company, through the operation of its 
              truck by its driver, then the plaintiffs would be entitled to recovery; 
              and, if not, of course, the plaintiffs would not be entitled to 
              recovery. So there you have the issues, gentlemen.&nbsp; You will 
              take the case and do justice between the parties.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jury rises to retire)<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a minute!&nbsp; If you get to 
              the question of damages, don't draw any inference, because the Court 
              neglected to state the rules as to damages, that I have in mind 
              there should be no recovery here.&nbsp; I have no such opinion.&nbsp; 
              It is for you, gentlemen, to say whether or not there should be 
              a recovery.&nbsp; Now if you get to the question of damages in the 
              case of Mr. Arrego, he would be entitled to such sum as you gentlemen 
              in your good judgment say he was entitled to by reason of the loss 
              of the boy.&nbsp; Now, the boy at that time was 7 years of age and, 
              on the proofs in the case, a jury may fix a value on the loss of 
              those services.&nbsp; During the time that the child was rendered 
              incapable of rendering service to the father, you may say the services 
              were worth something, or, under the proofs in this case, you may 
              say that they were worth nothing.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if, on looking the situation over, 
              they were worth something, then you could recompense the father 
              to a reasonable extent.&nbsp; If you say they were worth nothing, 
              then your verdict in the father's case would be &quot;No cause of 
              action,&quot; even though you had come to the conclusion that the 
              defendant here was liable.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the case of the little boy, 
              there, gentlemen, you would be entitled to give him such sum&#8230;.</p>

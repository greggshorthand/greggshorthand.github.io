              <p><strong>But there&#8217;s nothing haphazard about the principles 
                by which our reporters can simplify terms recurring day in and

            </div>
            <p align="center"><em>By</em> Charles Lee Swem<br />
              <em>Former Official Shorthand Reporter, New York Supreme Court</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sometimes wish that the word &#8220;shortcut&#8221; 
              had never been introduced as a recognized word in the terminology 
              of shorthand writing It is a good enough word and does express a 
              particular concept of abbreviation that we employ in reporting, 
              but it is a word that is much overemphasized, to the point that 
              there is usually ascribed to it an exaggerated meaning that it does 
              not possess. Fortunately for the beginning shorthand student, he 
              hears little of it as he learns the basic elements of shorthand, 
              for it plays little or no part in that early aspect of his shorthand 
              education. Yet once he has acquired a certain ability as a fast 
              writer and he contemplates a reporting career, he learns then, for 
              the first time, that there are other outlines and other phrases 
              that he has not been taught. &#8220;Shortcuts,&#8221; they are popularly 
              called. He notices, among other things, chiefly that they are shorter 
              and easier to write and, on the whole, much faster. So novel and 
              pleasing is the discovery that he jumps to the natural conclusion 
              that here is something that is going to relieve him of all his burdens.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This, unfortunately, is the attitude that the 
              inexperienced mind too often is led to accept by our common and 
              indiscriminate use of the term &#8220;shortcut&#8221;; for &#8220;short 
              cut&#8221; is not what we have in mind at all. Even the dictionary 
              does not sanction the usage of the word as strictly describing that 
              process of abbreviation by which our system has provided a catalogue 
              of shorter outlines and phrases common to reporting. &#8220;Shortcutting,&#8221; 
              as an ordinary English word, connotes something haphazard, hit-or-miss, 
              and spontaneous, which is as far removed as the poles from what 
              we mean when we &#8220;shortcut&#8221; in shorthand.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Abbreviate is a much better word, for &#8220;abbreviate,&#8221; 
              both in dictionary meaning and in common usage, implies a concept 
              of order and logic. One of the dictionary synonyms of &#8220;abbreviate&#8221; 
              is &#8220;curtail,&#8221; meaning literally to cut <em>off</em>&#8212;not 
              to cut <em>out</em> or to rearrange or to <em>gouge out</em>. The 
              fact is that all legitimate shortcutting is a process of curtailment 
              only&#8212;nothing else. Since &#8220;curtail&#8221; means essentially 
              to cut off the end, what is more accurately descriptive of our fundamental 
              Abbreviating Principle, by which we cut off the endings of words, 
              leaving the initial body of the word standing unaltered and clearly 
              suggestive of the complete word?</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But since we have and probably always shall 
              have the word &#8220;shortcut&#8221; with us, let us analyze the 
              function which we perform under that name and provide our own definition. 
              Fundamentally, we abbreviate or <em>curtail</em>. Let us take up 
              our methods of abbreviation in the order of their importance.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shorthand is described in the dictionary as 
              &#8220;a rapid method of writing by using symbols and abbreviations 
              for letters, words, etc.&#8221; Undoubtedly our first principle 
              of abbreviation is by means of symbols which we call <em>brief forms</em> 
              or, sometimes, <em>wordsigns</em>. These consist of the very brief 
              outlines for the commonest words of the language and may be classed 
              as symbols, although they are, for the most part, only curtailed 
              outlines. In all ordinary, nontechnical shorthand writing, these 
              are confined to those words making up the bulk of our normal, everyday 
              speech. We find this process of abbreviation illustrated in outlines 
              like</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ssc001.gif" alt="of, the, for, good, great, favor" width="300" height="41" /></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="center"><em>of, the, for, good, great, favor</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reporting, however, is not confined to the 
              writing of nontechnical language. It embraces all types of speech, 
              perhaps the greater part of it technical, and in all technical language 
              there are other words just as frequently recurring as the commonest 
              words of everyday speech. For these words, the system has provided 
              the same sort of abbreviated symbols or <em>brief forms</em>. Thus, 
              for the common words of legal terminology, we have such <em>brief 
              forms</em> as</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ssc002.gif" alt="plaintiff, defendant, covenant, subpoena, allegation, guilty, lawyer, evidence, policeman, reasonable, testimony, conclude, conclusive, recollection, complain(t), accident" width="325" height="161" /></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="center"><em>plaintiff, defendant, covenant, subpoena, 
                allegation, guilty, lawyer, evidence, policeman, reasonable, testimony, 
                conclude, conclusive, recollection, complain(t), accident</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In addition to which, many other words common to the wider general 
              vocabulary that the reporter must possess are also expressed by 
              brief forms; such, for instance, as</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ssc003.gif" alt="signal, actual, measure, live, trial, prior, pretty, rate, diameter, bottle" width="331" height="114" /></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="center"><em>signal, actual, measure, live, trial, prior, 
                pretty, rate, diameter, bottle</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It will be observed that none of these words 
              are haphazardly shortened, hut follow one or more of the principles 
              of abbreviation laid down in the Manual. They follow chiefly the 
              original Abbreviating Principle, which I might call the curtailing 
              principle, by which the tail is cut off but the head is left for 
              ready identification purposes. Words like <em>prior</em>, <em>trial</em>, 
              and <em>rate</em>, are perfect examples of forms that are curtailed 
              at the end of a distinctive vowel, where the following consonant 
              is not strongly stressed.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is principally in phrasing where the curtailing 
              of outline is practiced in reporting, but here, too, the curtailing 
              is practiced according to the same principle by which single words 
              are abbreviated. The governing principle for this kind of shortcutting 
              is what I have sometimes called the Word-and-a-Half Principle, meaning 
              simply the writing in full of the initial word of the phrase or 
              the compound, and then drastically shortening, or cutting off, the 
              rest&#8212;a logical and inevitable extension of the original Abbreviating 
              Principle.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is found in such compounds words as</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ssc004.gif" alt="football, baseball, bric-a-brac, upstairs, downstairs" width="273" height="88" /></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="center"><em>football, baseball, bric-a-brac, upstairs, 
                downstairs</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>but the principle becomes of special importance in the writing 
              of phrases. Consider how distinctive are the following phrases and 
              how consistently they are abbreviated:</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ssc005.gif" alt="glass of milk, pint of milk, atom bomb, opened the door, closed the door, main line, flight of stairs, half a block, about a block" width="339" height="161" /></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="center"><em>glass of milk, pint of milk, atom bomb, opened 
                the door, closed the door, main line, flight of stairs, half a 
                block, about a block</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modifying the principle but slightly, 
              we achieve such distinctive and rapid phrases as</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ssc006.gif" alt="complain(ed) of pain, complain(ed) of pain in the leg, complain(ed) of pain in the head, ice and snow, snow and ice, power of attorney" width="270" height="86" /></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="center"><em>complain(ed) of pain, complain(ed) of pain 
                in the leg, complain(ed) of pain in the head, ice and snow, snow 
                and ice, power of attorney</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth major principle of abbreviation 
              is a principle applied also to phrases for the most part, consisting 
              of the Intersecting Principle. This is a principle logically deriving 
              from the same original Abbreviating Principle, wherein the words 
              so phrased are abbreviated to their first stroke and intersected. 
              Consider how consistently logical and distinctive are the following 
              typical examples of this principle:</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ssc007.gif" alt="Board of Trade, Board of Directors, Great Britain, general manager, parcel post, vice versa, Grand Concourse" width="318" height="131" /></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="center"><em>Board of Trade, Board of Directors, Great 
                Britain, general manager, parcel post, vice versa, Grand Concourse</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Intersecting Principle probably finds its 
              greatest usefulness in the abbreviation of highly polysyllabic words 
              of common occurrence. In the last example, we are giving you a few 
              of the commonest long words occurring daily in the courts, logically 
              and systematically reduced to brief and legible outlines. You can 
              apply this principle to hundreds of other expressions that you meet 
              again and again in your daily work. </p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/ssc008.gif" alt="lumbar vertebrae, subpoena duces tecum, sacroiliac joint, multiple sclerosis, arteriosclerosis, fair and impartial verdict, coronary thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis" width="312" height="125" /></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="center"><em>lumbar vertebrae, subpoena duces tecum, sacroiliac 
                joint, multiple sclerosis, arteriosclerosis, fair and impartial 
                verdict, coronary thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have thus illustrated the four major principles 
              of abbreviation employed by reporters: the Brief Form or wordsign, 
              the Abbreviating Principle, the Word-and-a-Half Principle, and the 
              Intersecting Principle. They all stern from the Abbreviating Principle 
              taught in the Manual. Their use is neither haphazard nor arbitrary, 
              but follows one consistent concept of abbreviation, that of writing 
              the initial and distinctive body of the word or phrase, and confining 
              whatever abbreviating is done to the less distinctive or ending 
              of the word or phrase. Curtailing, if you please, and not &#8220;shortcutting.&#8221;</p>

              Department of Labor in New York City, gives an interesting example 
              of these principles in practice.</p>

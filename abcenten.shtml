              <em>Tenth Edition</em><br />
              (1988-Present) </p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This series is the current standard of Gregg 
              Shorthand. &nbsp;It is of a more sensible difficulty than Series 
              90. It is essentially a revival of Diamond Jubilee with several 
              differences. &nbsp;This series brought back the idea of letting 
              one brief form outline represent more than one word, thus the word 
              <em>during</em> was brought back.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are <a href="cenbfs.shtml">139 
              brief forms that represent 162 words</a>. &nbsp;The system is closer 
              to Diamond Jubilee than any other series. &nbsp;In comparison to 
              Diamond Jubilee, a few changes were made:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Any</em>, <em>convenience</em>, <em>direct</em>, 
                <em>office</em>, <em>privilege</em>, <em>property</em>, <em>responsible</em>, 
                and<em> usual</em> were re-added;</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Anniversary</em>, <em>appropriate</em>, 
                <em>communicate</em>, <em>equip</em>, <em>executive</em>, <em>equivalent</em>, 
                <em>incorporate</em>, <em>insurance</em>, <em>Ms</em>., <em>product</em>, 
                <em>recommend</em>, <em>reluctance</em>, and <em>reluctant</em> 
                were added;</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Electric</em>, <em>include</em>, and 
                <em>program</em> were classified as brief forms;</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>How</em>, <em>purpose</em>, <em>put</em>, 
                <em>shall</em>, <em>such</em>, <em>situation</em>, <em>those</em>, 
                <em>upon</em>, <em>use</em>, <em>why</em>, and <em>yet</em> were 
                removed from the brief form list.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The word <em>work</em> was changed back into 
                its original form, <em>r k</em>, and several words were edited 
                into different outlines.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This series was probably a revival attempt by the authors 
              of Gregg to make the Light-Line Phonography popular again after 
              Series 90 somewhat ruined its reputation. It is unfortunate that the 
              final textbook on Centennial Gregg Shorthand was the first one, 
              written in 1988. This book is very much like any standard textbook from the 1980s, but it was the first Gregg Shorthand manual not to have had a platewriter writing all the outlines for it. According to one of the last platewriters who worked for the Gregg division, one of the workers there cut and pasted the outlines from older books. As a result, the outlines have clear thickness variances.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A much more apparent difference possibly brought about by this method of production was the complete eradication of a standard for outline placement on the writing line. While this might carry on the dream of J. R. Gregg  to have no position writing at all, a loss of a standard of outline placement was probably not the most advantageous change to the system.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Business dictation was dead.</em>&nbsp; Society had, for the most part, lost interest in 
              Gregg Shorthand by the time this edition was published. &nbsp;Most high schools simply ended the Gregg Shorthand 
              program altogether, without even giving Centennial a chance.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Regardless of the fall of Gregg Shorthand, 
              Centennial shorthand still is able to record speech onto paper with 
              good accuracy and speed. &nbsp;This version seems well suited for 
              today's society, with changes like the removal of <em>must</em> 
              for the modern title <em>Ms</em>., which is becoming commoner as 
              times progress. &nbsp;This system maintains its ease of learning 
              and its practicality in the modern world.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In reading some of the letters which were received 
              while I was on a trip to Australia, I found a very interesting paragraph 
              in a letter from Mr. John A. Bell of Glasgow.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the paragraph in Mr. Bell&#8217;s letter 
              suggests an interesting topic, I am going to use it as a text, as 
              it were, for the first of a series of articles on the scientific 
              principles underlying the system. Mr. Bell writes:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In reading 
              over this month&#8217;s Magazine I could not but admire the beautifully 
              written page on the Fauna of the Alps. I remember when I was studying 
              architecture for an art certificate a number of years ago being 
              struck by a remark made by a writer who was comparing Greek and 
              Roman architecture. He said that the reason why Greek architecture 
              was more beautiful than Roman was that it was based on the ellipse, 
              which, on account of its variety, is impelling to the eye. Do you 
              see the point? That is the reason for the pleasure which a page 
              of Gregg gives if one has looked over several pages of Pitman. </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is needless 
              to say that, like Mr. Bell, every writer of the system finds delight 
              in the artistic beauty of its forms and in the easy, natural character 
              of the writing. These qualities are commented on again and again 
              in the letters we receive. But doubtless few writers have tried, 
              as Mr. Bell has done, to find definite <em>reasons</em> for either 
              the artistic qualities of the system or its easy-writing qualities.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the derivation of them may be interesting 
              to our friends, I am going to discuss them in a series of articles. 
              In doing this I intend, first, to explain the general basic principles 
              of the system, and, second, to show how these fundamental principles 
              have been applied in the selection and arrangement of the alphabet. 
              It is necessary to have a clear understanding of the entire plan 
              of structure as a whole to appreciate the working out of the details. 
              I hope, therefore, that if you are interested in the subject, you 
              will read the explanation of each basic principle, and carefully 
              weigh its relative importance to the whole plan. If you do this 
              I believe you will find a new interest in the system, and be able 
              to give convincing reasons for the faith that is within you.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Fundamental Difference. &#8212;</strong><br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fundamental difference between geometric 
              shorthand and Gregg Shorthand is this: Geometric shorthand is based 
              on the <em>circle</em> and its segments; Gregg is based on the <em>ellipse</em>, 
              or oval.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As geometric shorthand is based on the circle, 
              its characters are supposed to be drawn with geometric precision, 
              and are struck in all directions. The characters, being struck in 
              all directions, necessitate continual change in the position of 
              the hand while writing.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Gregg Shorthand is based on the ellipse or 
              oval, it is written with a uniform slope, as in longhand. Its characters 
              are, therefore, familiar and natural to the hand, and like longhand 
              do not require a change in the position of the hand while writing. 
              When we say, &#8220;with a uniform slope as in longhand&#8221; we 
              do not mean any particular slope; we simply mean that whatever slope 
              is adopted the writing is uniform in slope&#8212;not zig-zag. This 
              is understood by all writers of the system, but I consider it advisable 
              to include the statement here, as an effort is being made to represent 
              us as insisting upon a particular slope.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Short-<em>Writing</em> or Short-<em>Drawing</em>?</strong>&#8212;Geometric 
              shorthand has been described as a rapid drawing of characters, while 
              Gregg Shorthand has been described as a rapid writing. That the 
              affinity of geometric shorthand to drawing is fully recognized by 
              the advocates of that style, will be clear from the following quotations.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Isaac Pitman, in the seventh edition of his 
              Manual said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The student should be careful not to hold 
                the pen as for common writing, for this position of the hand is 
                adapted for the formation of letters constructed upon a totally 
                different principle from those of Phonography. The pen should 
                be held loosely in the hand, <em>like a pencil for drawing</em>, 
                with the nib turned in such a manner that the letter &#8220;b&#8221; 
                can be struck with ease.
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a series of articles on &#8220;Aids and 
              Hindrances to Shorthand Writing&#8221; in <em>Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand 
              Weekly</em>, Mr. Alfred Kingston said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have frequently noticed that the shorthand 
                student skilled in thawing always makes the best start upon the 
                shorthand alphabet. The student should be encouraged, therefore, 
                to treat the preliminary work of mastering the simple geometric 
                forms, and especially the curves, <em>as something really in the 
                nature of a drawing lesson</em>, and to draw them as carefully 
                and accurately as possible at the start.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Andrew J. Graham, author of the most successful 
              American modification of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, in the Introduction 
              to Part Two of his &#8220;Standard Phonography,&#8221; said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The position given to the pen and hand in 
                backhand writing seems best adapted for the easy and graceful 
                formation of phonographic characters. The pen should be held very 
                loosely, so that the nib may be readily turned and suited to the 
                execution of characters made in various directions.
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These quotations will prove that the geometric 
              style of shorthand is admitted to resemble a drawing &#8212; not 
              a writing &#8212; of characters.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although they do not bear directly on the question 
              of the drawing or the writing of the characters, the views expressed 
              by very prominent Pitman reporters about &#8216;the comparative 
              facility of the back slope and forward slope characters may be of 
              interest at this point.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Henry M. Parkhurst, one of the most prominent 
              of the early pioneers of &#8220;Pitman&#8217;s Phonography,&#8221; 
              and the &#8220;Spelling Reform&#8221; in America, said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stroke for <em>p</em> [a back-slope character 
                in Pitman] cannot be struck with the same ease as <em>ch</em> 
                [a stroke like our <em>j</em>] because the <em>muscles of the 
                fingers naturally move in the direction of the latter stroke</em>, 
                and not in the direction of the former. The cords, muscles, etc., 
                all strain from the inside of the limbs; and consequently all 
                those who use the right hand in writing can write with greater 
                rapidity and endure longer in writing from right to left than 
                they can in writing from left to right.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. George R. Bishop, for many years an official 
              reporter of the New York Stock Exchange, and formerly President 
              of the New York State Stenographers&#8217; Association, in discussing 
              the various shorthand characters, said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The directions or slopes of some strokes 
                are quite different from any to which the fingers become accustomed 
                by writing ordinary longhand; the muscles therefore require to 
                be trained to these unfamiliar movements and directions by much 
                practice.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The famous reporter, David Wolfe Brown, for 
              many years one of the staff of official reporters of the House of 
              Representatives, Washington, in his book, &#8220;Mastery of Shorthand,&#8221; 
              which was published by the Phonographic Institute Company (publishers 
              of Benn Pitman Shorthand), declares:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even in those rare cases where the phonographic 
                pupil shows by his ordinary penmanship not only an eye for truth 
                and beauty of form, but a real facility of hand, it is a facility 
                adapted exclusively to the peculiar forms and inclination of the 
                longhand characters; and there remains great need for special 
                manual discipline by reason of the variety of forms and directions 
                of the shorthand characters.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Brown expands this thought in his popular 
              book, &#8220;The Factors of Shorthand Speed&#8221;:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the shorthand writer&#8217;s manual discipline 
                the first step is to<em> get rid of certain habits often acquired 
                in longhand</em>, and which, unless corrected, must make high 
                stenographic speed a physical impossibility. It may be desirable, 
                for a time at least, that longhand practice be as far as possible 
                suspended, so that a new set of manual habits may be the more 
                easily acquired.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the habits which shorthand writers 
                need especially to overcome arises from the peculiar slant of 
                the longhand characters. . . . As the shorthand characters are 
                written in almost every direction&#8212;probably more of them 
                with a backward inclination, or with a horizontal motion, than 
                with a forward slope&#8212;the hand and fingers, in being educated 
                for shorthand writing, must be emancipated from the fixed position 
                to which they have been accustomed in longhand.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From these extracts 
              it will be seen that, instead of previous experience and training 
              in the writing of longhand being regarded as an advantage to the 
              student of geometric shorthand, it is declared by these high authorities 
              to be an obstacle. To do good work in geometric shorthand the student 
              is told that he must &#8220;get rid of certain habits acquired in 
              longhand,&#8221; and his &#8220;hand and fingers must be emancipated 
              from the position to which they have been accustomed in longhand.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Logical Deduction.</strong> &#8212; 
              If what these eminent authors and reporters say is true&#8212;and 
              what advocate of Pitman Shorthand will challenge their statements?&#8212;then 
              the student or writer of a system founded on longhand, requiring 
              the same position of hand and fingers, and the same movements as 
              longhand, starts on the study with a tremendous initial advantage 
              over the student or writer of geometric shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;The planets move in elliptic orbits.&#8221; 
              We claim that the ellipse is a more scientific basis for a system 
              of brief writing than the circle.<sup><a href="basicp03.html#1">1</a></sup> 
              Our beautiful Roman writing is based on the ellipse, or oval, and 
              being the outcome of a process of evolution that has been going 
              on for centuries, it represents the &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; 
              in the movements and characters best adapted to the hand. As Benn 
              Pitman says in his &#8220;Life and Labors of Sir Isaac Pitman,&#8221; 
              our present writing is &#8220;but the culmination and fruition of 
              a series of experiments, changes and improvements which were commenced 
              in the very childhood of civilization, and which have been uninterruptedly 
              continued to the present time. From the earliest pictorial and hieroglyphic 
              symbols there has been an unending series of experiments and improvements, 
              and each step has been received with more or less of hesitancy and 
              distrust because of the inconvenience attending a change of habit. 
              . . . The simplest, most convenient, and most reasonable way of 
              doing anything is usually the last to come, but when the right thing 
              is accepted it seems amazing that the inferior and imperfect one 
              should have been tolerated, much less loved and tenaciously adhered 
              to.&#8221; [There is an almost prophetic ring about that last sentence!]<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Benefits Admitted.</strong> &#8212;If 
              if be true that the movements and characters used for longhand writing 
              have been adopted because they are easy and natural to the hand, 
              we believe that it does not require argument to prove that the same 
              easy, natural movements and characters are the logical basis of 
              a briefer style of writing. Indeed, nearly all authors and expert 
              writers of geometric shorthand have been willing to acknowledge 
              this, but have asserted that, on account of the limited shorthand 
              material, it was impossible to construct a practical system on such 
              a basis.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the first International Shorthand Congress, 
              in 1887, Professor J. D. Everett, author of &#8220;Everett&#8217;s 
              Shorthand for General Use,&#8221; a geometric system, acknowledged 
              that, &#8220;to employ characters which slope all one way is advantageous 
              in so far as it enables the writer to make a given number of movements 
              in a given time.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Edwin Guest, the author of &#8220;Compendious 
              Shorthand,&#8221; a geometric system, in a discussion at one of 
              the meetings of The Shorthand Society, London, is reported to have 
              frankly admitted that, &#8220;if any script system could be written 
              with <em>only double the number of strokes in a geometric system</em>, 
              he was prepared to admit the advantage was in favor of the script 
              system.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1888 Mr. Thomas Allen Reed, the most famous 
              of all the English champions of Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, in referring 
              to some shorthand notes which had been contrasted as to <em>brevity</em>, 
              with longhand, at one of the meetings of The Shorthand Society, 
              London, is reported to have said that he thought &#8220;Dr. Gower 
              had overlooked one point&#8212;<em>the advantage of the one slope</em>&#8221; 
              in the longhand specimen.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>The Reporters&#8217; Journal</em> (England), 
              January, 1891, in giving reasons for objecting to the suggested 
              substitution of the downward (backslope) <em>r</em> for the upward 
              <em>r</em> before m (a suggestion which has since been adopted by 
              Isaac Pit-man &amp; Sons) said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are, nevertheless, as firmly convinced 
                as ever that the upward <em>r</em> is struck, either alone or 
                in combination, very much easier and with greater facility than 
                its downward companion.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The very act of having to draw the pen backward 
                tells against the downward <em>r</em>, and surely phonographers 
                can quickly ascertain for themselves the more advantageous outline 
                by writing each for the same space of time.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>A Convincing Demonstration.</strong> 
              &#8212; In a paper on &#8220;The True Theory of Shorthand,&#8221; 
              read before the Shorthand Society, London, Mr. Thomas Anderson, 
              author of the &#8220;History of Shorthand,&#8221; stated the absurdity 
              of zig-zag writing very effectively:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am not now raising the question whether 
                writing on the slope from right to left, or writing perpendicularly, 
                or nearly so, or, again, writing on the back slope, is the quicker 
                or quickest method of writing. I say I do not now raise that question. 
                I give no opinion on it&#8212;nor am I concerned what may be the 
                decision regarding it.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But this I do earnestly and strenuously maintain, 
                that the attempt to write in these three different directions 
                at one and the same time is absurd. Just take the word <em>absurd</em></p>

            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>as an example It is a good word for the purpose. Now if I am 
                to write the &#8220;a&#8221; on the common slope, the &#8220;b&#8221; 
                on the back slope, and the &#8220;a&#8221; straight up and down, 
                and follow any other variety of the same changes with the other 
                letters of the word, namely, &#8220;u,&#8221; &#8220;r,&#8221; 
                &#8220;d,&#8221; then I make bold to say that the word and the 
                thing signified are both demonstrated in the same form&#8212;a 
                form with which you offend the eye, as well as threaten dislocation 
                to the hand.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is idle to answer that the habit is followed 
                by thousands of shorthand writers without much difficulty, or 
                it may be said even with ease. Granted. What then? The praise 
                is to the hand, which, as Aristotle has well said, is &#8220;the 
                instrument of instruments.&#8221; We are not, however, entitled 
                on that account to visit it with an unnecessary infliction.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I may, in concluding my observations under 
                this head, allude to the fact that an inspection of any paleographical 
                folios will show, on a comparison of the ruder forms of writing 
                with the more modern in almost all languages, a tendency to have 
                the characters all on the one slope. The fact is interesting rather 
                than here important, but if anyone cares to turn over the princely 
                tomes of Silvester in his &#8220;Paleographique Universelle,&#8221; 
                he will perceive this to be very noticeable.</p>

              In an article on &#8220;The &#8216;One Slope&#8217; Theory in Shorthand,&#8221; 
              Mr. G. C. Mares stated the practical advantages obtained from uniformity 
              of slope in a very convincing way:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It will be evident to the vast majority of 
                shorthand writers that in Pitman Shorthand many words can be written 
                much faster than others, even though the number of pen strokes 
                and ineffective movements (lifts) are the same. Thus the word 
                <em>cherry</em> can be written faster than <em>pity</em>, <em>reject</em> 
                is more facile than <em>shave</em>, although it has an additional 
                stroke, and the same may be said of hundreds of other words. What 
                causes the difference in facility? The answer is that <em>cherry</em>, 
                <em>reject</em>, are written on the &#8220;one slope,&#8221; whilst 
                <em>pity</em>,<sup><a href="basicp03.html#2">2<em> </em></a></sup><em>shave</em>, 
                employ back strokes. At the commencement, then, we see that an 
                advantage exists in favor of one-slope writing; but no one has 
                yet, I believe, shown the existence of this advantage. I will, 
                therefore, invite attention to the following figures:<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) A rapid penman can write 30 words a minute; 
                each word containing on an average of 16 movements&#8212;16 &times; 
                30 equals 480 <em>longhand strokes</em> a minute.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) The limit of the power of the hand to 
                form <em>shorthand</em> strokes, is, at the outside figure, 300 
                a minute; 300 to 480 shows 60 per cent in favor of <em>longhand 
                strokes</em>.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) As the formation of shorthand strokes 
                requires more care than longhand, on account of the necessary 
                observance of length, thickness, etc., an allowance of, say 25 
                per cent must be made, and this, with an allowance of 10 per cent 
                for loss of brevity (if any) as compared with other systems, will 
                leave us 25 per cent advantage in the matter of facility of execution 
                <em>gained by the use of one-sloped or longhand signs or strokes</em>. 
                . .</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>All Natural Writing Elliptical.</strong> 
              &#8212; It has been said that it is impossible for the human hand 
              to make a <em>perfect</em> circle in rapid writing. On the other 
              hand, elliptic figures are natural and easy to the hand; indeed, 
              the making of an ellipse or oval is one of the first exercises given 
              a child in learning ordinary writing. As a writer on the subject 
              has said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No alphabet on the radii of the circle with 
                its various arcs can be easy to write. The circle is the most 
                difficult of all simple forms. It is astonishing that modem inventors 
                of shorthand should have overlooked the experience of all nations 
                in the writing of longhand, and therefore, it is clear that the 
                efforts to secure speed have developed the forms employed away 
                from the circle into arcs and axes of the inclined ellipse. No 
                hand at rest can rapidly execute the circle, while all easy movements 
                of the arm, hand and fingers resting on the paper form the lines 
                of the ellipses. Is it not remarkable that after having based 
                the alphabet on the circle Pitman should say in the &#8220;Reporters&#8217; 
                Companion,&#8221; &#8220;Theoretically, every line employed in 
                phonography is a light line or an arc of some circle. Practically 
                all light lines become to fluent writers portions of ellipses. 
                The most continuous line that can be described is the flattened 
                ellipse. The greater the velocity, the flatter the arc.&#8221;</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The older script, cursive, graphic, scripthand, 
              or pasigraphic systems &#8212; as they are variously termed &#8212; 
              claimed to be &#8220;founded on longhand.&#8221; That claim was 
              based on the fact that they rejected vertical and back-slope characters, 
              and were written with a &#8220;uniform slope.&#8221; The title page 
              of one of the first of these systems, that of Richard Roe, published 
              in 1802, described it as &#8220;A new system of Shorthand in which 
              legibility and brevity are secured upon the most <em>natural principles</em>, 
              especially by the singular property of their<em> sloping all one 
              way</em> according to the habitual motion of the hand in common 
              writing.&#8221; This is the claim of all the systems on that basis 
              &#8212; there is little change in the wording.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While <em>uniformity of slope</em> is very important, 
              it is but one of the virtues of longhand writing, and it is a question 
              whether or not it is the most important one. Let us consider some 
              of the other qualities of longhand.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Other Longhand Features.</strong> &#8212; 
              <em>In longhand writing there is no compulsory shading or thickening 
              of the characters.</em><br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to the appearance of Gregg Shorthand nearly 
              all the systems claiming to be &#8220;founded on longhand&#8221; 
              had shading or thickening of the characters. Some, indeed, had shaded 
              upward characters, and shaded horizontal characters &#8212; even 
              shaded small circles and shaded hooks! If we accept longhand as 
              our model &#8212; if we are absolutely sincere about it &#8212; 
              we are bound to acknowledge that freedom from compulsory shading 
              is just as important as is the uniform slope.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>In longhand writing the words are not placed 
              in several positions with relation to the line of writing</em>.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to the appearance of Gregg Shorthand, 
              many of the systems said to be &#8220;founded on longhand&#8221; 
              had words placed in three or more positions &#8212; on the line, 
              above the line, and through or below the line. Here, again, if we 
              accept longhand as our model, we are bound to acknowledge that the 
              use of several different &#8220; positions&#8221; for distinguishing 
              words is not admissible.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>In longhand writing all the letters, vowels, 
              and consonants are joined.</em><br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But some of the systems claiming to be &#8220;founded 
              on longhand&#8221; (notably &#8220;Sonography,&#8221; by Rev. D. 
              S. Davies, and &#8220;English Script Shorthand,&#8221; by John Westby-Gibson) 
              expressed the vowels by disjoined signs after the consonantal skeleton 
              of the word was completed.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are other features in many of the systems 
              said to be &#8220;based on longhand&#8221; prior to the publication 
              of Gregg Shorthand, which were inconsistent with that claim. Among 
              these may be mentioned the presence of many obtuse angles, which 
              do not occur in longhand. I intend to speak of these things later.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>A Process of Evolution.</strong> &#8212; 
              I should be sorry if you gained the impression from what I have 
              said that I am attempting to disparage previous endeavors at the 
              construction of a system on natural lines. This is not the case. 
              I am simply explaining certain fundamental differences between the 
              structure of our system and the systems that preceded it.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The following quotation from the &#8220;Story 
              of Gregg Shorthand,&#8221; as told at the Silver Jubilee meetings 
              (and afterwards published in pamphlet form) will show that I have 
              always been ready to pay a tribute to preceding authors:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I regard that alphabet as a natural evolution 
                of the best principles of all systems mentioned. In its making, 
                therefore, credit is due to the great shorthand authors of the 
                past, whose genius cleared the path for progress. The chief distinction 
                I claim for Gregg Shorthand is that while other systems embody 
                one or more natural principles&#8212; such as absence of shading 
                or position of writing, or uniform slant, or lineal, continuous 
                movement, or connective vowels&#8212;Gregg Shorthand is the only 
                system embodying all these natural features. And it is the only 
                system, I venture to say, that satisfies the eye with the freedom 
                and gracefulness of its forms.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the course of this series of articles I 
              hope to make it clear that there has been a gradual evolution toward 
              a system that would be &#8220;the distilled essence of our common 
              writing.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have often heard advocates of Pitmanic Shorthand 
              dispose of other systems with a contemptuous expression, and then 
              mention several systems that were once fairly wellknown, but have 
              now declined in popularity, as proof of the superiority of Pitman. 
              That is very superficial reasoning. It is on a par with the shortsightedness 
              of the people who ridiculed the early inventors of the aeroplane 
              because their first air flights were not <em>entirely</em> successful. 
              To the thoughtful investigator even the <em>partial</em> success 
              of systems founded on principles entirely different from those of 
              Pitman has great significance. It would be easy to demonstrate that 
              each of these systems succeeded in almost exact proportion to the 
              degree in which it contained <em>natural</em> writing features, 
              and failed to attain greater success because it retained or extended 
              the use of certain <em>unnatural</em> writing features. In some 
              instances these systems, while incorporating one or two longhand 
              features, pushed the use of principles or expedients opposed to 
              longhand to a much greater extreme than is done in the Pitman system.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>A Prediction Fulfilled.</strong> &#8212; 
              Mr. Thomas Anderson, who was for many years a reporter in the Law 
              Courts of Glasgow (using the Pitman system), and who wrote a very 
              valuable and scholarly &#8220;History of Shorthand,&#8221; expressed 
              this opinion:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make shorthand what it ought to be, it 
                must follow the track of the longhand writing, be all written 
                on the one slope, and make no difference between thin and thick 
                strokes, while describing accurately the vowels. . .<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that such a system would, in the 
                course of a few years effect a comparatively universal change, 
                by the side of which the results attained by the Pitman plan in 
                the course of the last fifty years would look anything but magnificent.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considering the date at which it was written&#8212;1882&#8212;this 
              was a remarkable prediction.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the beliefs of shorthand inventors and 
              of others who are enthusiastic about the benefits to be derived 
              from the widespread study and practice of shorthand, is that it 
              will eventually take the place of longhand to a very large extent. 
              That belief is a very reasonable one.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For many years there was printed on the covers 
              of Isaac Pitman&#8217;s books the following extract from an article 
              which appeared in the <em>English Review</em>:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;Who that is much in the habit of writing 
              has not often wished for some means of expressing by two or three 
              dashes of the pen that which, as things are, it requires such an 
              expenditure of time and labor to commit to paper? Our present mode 
              of communication must be felt to be cumbersome in the last degree; 
              unworthy of these days of invention. We require some means of bringing 
              the operations of the mind, and of the hand, into closer correspondence.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If that was true fifty years ago, it is even 
              more true of conditions today. There is an ever-increasing pressure, 
              and it does seem absurd that we should be obliged to continue to 
              employ the cumbrous forms of longhand when a briefer method is at 
              our disposal. Articles have been published demonstrating that millions 
              of hours a day could be saved by the general use of shorthand in 
              correspondence and in making notations. But it has been recognized 
              as a fact&#8212;an extraordinary and inexplicable fact&#8212;that 
              many of those who know shorthand are not inclined to use it in their 
              literary and other work. It has been noted also that writers of 
              our system are much more inclined to use shorthand in this way than 
              are the writers of the older styles. In our own offices, for instance, 
              nearly all the managers of departments jot down in shorthand the 
              answers to letters on the back of the letters, and hand them to 
              the stenographers instead of dictating, and this plan is followed 
              in much of the correspondence between offices and in the composition 
              of articles, advertisements, etc. Even the reports of our travelling 
              representatives are made in shorthand&#8212;the original report 
              in shorthand being sent to the manager of the local office, and 
              a carbon copy sent to the General Sales Manager in the Executive 
              Department.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Shorthand for Personal Use.</strong> 
              &#8212; Speaking offhand one would say that the mental attitude 
              which induces such a large percentage of writers of our system to 
              use shorthand more freely and confidently as a personal time-saving 
              instrument, as compared with the small percentage of writers of 
              the older systems who do so, is due to the greater legibility of 
              our system on account of the insertion of vowels, the absence of 
              shading, and position writing&#8212;all of which make the writing 
              more easy and natural. All these things contribute a good deal, 
              because they create confidence and relieve the mind of much conscious 
              effort; but there is another reason, which is probably more important 
              still. It will be found in an article by a distinguished shorthand 
              reporter who was also an author of distinction.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some years ago the <em>Phonographic World</em> 
              published a series of articles on&#8220;How Authors Write,&#8221; 
              and the late Philander Deming, who was an author of distinction 
              as well as a shorthand reporter, said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With slight exceptions, my literary work 
                has been done with the pen. . . . This is done without any rule 
                and without thought about it. <em>But the strong tendency is, 
                when I am most intent upon my work, to use only longhand forms</em>. 
                I suppose this is because the longhand is made up by the repetition 
                of so small a number of radical elements. You will call to mind 
                the fact that the Spencerian analysis and system of penmanship 
                shows us that the working letters (the small letters) of our common 
                writing are formed of only four radical elements. These four elements 
                form the entire alphabet. The result of this formation is that, 
                while it requires considerable muscular action to write longhand, 
                the work of writing calls for very little attention on the part 
                of the mind of the writer.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Phonography is based upon twelve radical elements. 
                The writing, therefore, is not a continual choice from among four 
                elements, <em>but from among twelve, and this rapid choosing among 
                so many is difficult and the work is complex. Hence. the writer 
                has to give his attention to the form in writing them, and this 
                continues to be true, however extensive his experience in writing 
                phonography may have been.</em> The moment a writer becomes deeply 
                interested in his subject he forgets to write shorthand; his pen 
                glides unconsciously into the longhand forms. It will be remembered 
                that Charles Dickens was a shorthand writer. He reported the debates 
                in Parliament, and he has described his struggles in learning 
                shorthand in a well-known and often-quoted story&#8212;and yet 
                all his literary work was done in longhand writing.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; To the thoughtful reader this quotation may have 
              a great deal of significance. It represents a phase of this subject 
              which is seldom given any consideration. In using our system there 
              is greater <em>mental freedom</em> than there is in writing geometric 
              shorthand, because, like longhand, the writing in our system consists 
              of a few familiar elements.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the next chapter I shall discuss what I believe 
              to be the most important element of either longhand or shorthand 
              writing. It is not longhand slope, connective vowels, absence of 
              shading, or the elimination of position writing. It is seldom mentioned, 
              but it is, nevertheless, the greatest feature of the system &#8212; 
              the one which, above all others, distinguishes it from all other 
              systems. Can you guess what it is?</p>

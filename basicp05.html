            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In beginning the previous chapter I said that 
              the importance of curvilinear motion in the system was not fully 
              appreciated by many writers and teachers. But the application of 
              curve motion in the formation of the Blended Consonants is more 
              than appreciated&#8212;it is the feature which, above all others, 
              is warmly commended by writers of our system and even by writers 
              of other systems. I suppose this is because other curve combinations 
              are obtained by the mere joining of the characters&#8212;as in <em>pr</em>, 
              <em>br</em>, <em>pl</em>, <em>bl</em>, <em>kr</em>, <em>kl</em>, 
              <em>gr</em>, <em>gl</em>, <em>fr</em>, <em>fl</em>, etc.&#8212;and 
              therefore require no conscious thought, whereas the blends are obtained 
              by the entirely original plan of allowing lines forming the obtuse 
              angle to blend in the form of a curve. Whatever the reason may be, 
              there is no question about the enthusiasm which the blending principle 
              evokes.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>A System Discussion. </strong>&#8212; 
              The origin of the blending principle is a rather interesting illustration 
              of how a valuable principle may be developed from a mere passing 
              suggestion. In discussing an earlier effort at shorthand construction 
              with Mr. William Pettigrew (a well-known Glasgow man who had been 
              prominent in the advancement of Pitman&#8217;s Phonography in its 
              early days) he strongly criticized the presence of many obtuse angles 
              in the specimens I showed him. Then he vehemently declared that 
              he had always maintained that the greatest weakness in the Pitman 
              system was the presence of many obtuse angles. Taking a piece of 
              paper he illustrated this by joining in succession the Pitman signs 
              for <em>p-k</em>, <em>k-p</em>, <em>t-ch</em>, <em>ch-t</em>, <em>p-t</em>, 
              <em>t-p</em>, <em>k-r</em>, <em>r-k</em>; next, he ran through a 
              similar series with the thickened letters, beginning with <em>b-g</em>; 
              then, the same series of characters with thick and thin strokes 
              alternating; and finally he wrote the curve and straight line combinations 
              like <em>l-p</em>, <em>f-r</em> (upward <em>r</em>), <em>r-sh</em> 
              (downward <em>sh</em>), <em>t-sh</em> (upward <em>sh</em>), <em>m-ch</em>, 
              etc.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After each example he would say with great emphasis, 
              &#8220;In rapid writing those lines will run together in the form 
              of a large curve. You can&#8217;t prevent it unless you write very 
              carefully&#8221;&#8212;and so on for at least an hour.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was evidently a hobby with him; and he had 
              discussed it so many times with other phonographers that he had 
              the illustrations at his fingers&#8217; ends. I omitted to say that 
              Mr. Pettigrew had left the phonographic ranks because, like Mr. 
              T. A. Reed, Mr. William Relton, and others, he objected to the introduction 
              of the large initial hooks and some of the other changes made in 
              the system.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I listened to his exposition with considerable 
              deference for I was very young at that time, and Mr. Pettigrew was 
              a man of standing in the community &#8212; a member of the City 
              Council, I believe. But when he had finished his denunciation of 
              the obtuse angles in Pitman I ventured to point out that the outlines 
              in the specimens submitted to him were on the longhand slope and, 
              therefore, there could be only <em>two</em> obtuse angles&#8212;those 
              between the horizontal line and the upward straight line, and <em>vice 
              versa</em>&#8212;while in Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand there were no 
              less than <em>eight</em> obtuse angles <em>between straight lines 
              alone</em>. The occurrence of these eight, too, was doubled by shading 
              (<em>b-g</em>, etc.) and tripled by alternating light and heavy 
              characters (<em>b-k</em>, <em>k-b</em>, etc.).<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that is 
              an improvement, but why have them at all? Why not have alternative 
              characters for these upward and horizontal letters so as to exclude 
              the obtuse angles? Besides, these letters are common letters [at 
              that time I had adopted the Duployan arrangement of the horizontal 
              line for <em>t</em>, <em>d</em>, and the upward line for <em>r</em>, 
              <em>l</em>,], and <em>tr</em>, <em>dr</em>, will run together. To 
              prevent that you will have to slow up in the writing,&#8212;you 
              can&#8217;t observe those angles in rapid writing. Besides, you 
              may say the t and d slant upward slightly. That makes the angle 
              less acute and the lines more liable to run together. To prevent 
              this you ought to provide alternative signs for them.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Incidentally, I may say that a little while 
              afterwards an attempt was made to overcome this tendency by a special 
              &#8220;positional&#8221; expedient which, however, could be applied 
              only at the <em>beginning</em> of words.)<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Pettigrew was somewhat mollified by my contention 
              that the <em>number</em> of obtuse angles was greatly reduced by 
              the adoption of the longhand slope, and soon afterward he was won 
              over to at least an academic support of the system. To be fair about 
              it, I believe that his controversies with orthodox phonographers 
              inclined him to support almost any system that promised to vindicate 
              one of his theories!<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The last time I was in Glasgow I called at Mr. 
              Pettigrew&#8217;s shop, but was grieved to hear that he had passed 
              to the Great Beyond. I had looked forward with pleasant anticipation 
              to telling him the momentous consequences that came from that discussion 
              so many years ago. Doubtless I should have discovered the blending 
              principle in working out the curvilinear motion principle to its 
              logical conclusion; but I am inclined to believe that unconsciously 
              Mr. Pettigrew started the train of thought which resulted in the 
              discovery of a new principle in shorthand by which the obtuse angle 
              has been almost entirely eliminated.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Execrated Obtuse Angles. </strong>&#8212; 
              I am sure that Mr. Pettigrew would have read with delight and hearty 
              approval the following passages which I found some time ago in the 
              preface to Munson&#8217;s &#8220;Shorthand Dictionary&#8221; written 
              by the author of one of the most popular textbooks on Pitmanic shorthand 
              in the United States:</p>
            <blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We often see theorizing authors of 
              shorthand works demonstrating by rule and dividers and by the counting 
              of pen-strokes, the superiority of their systems in point of speed; 
              while they fail to take cognizance on the other hand of the many 
              hindrances to speed that inhere in their outlines. </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Munson then proceeds to discuss these hindrances. 
              One of them he names as:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Too frequent obtuse angles between stems&#8212;a 
                very great impediment to speed</em>, as may be readily demonstrated 
                by tracing with exactness, but as quickly as possible, a line 
                like the first of the following diagrams, and then in like manner, 
                one like the second.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Mr. Munson then gives two lines of outlines, 
              one with sharp, and the other with obtuse angles.) He adds:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It will be seen that the outline with obtuse 
                or blunt angles requires a much slower movement than the one with 
                sharp angles.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Benn Pitman and Jerome B. Howard, in their 
              &#8220;Reporter&#8217;s Companion,&#8221; in discussing the &#8220;graphic 
              impediments to phrasing,&#8221; state that the presence of an obtuse 
              angle may be a &#8220;sufficient reason for breaking a phrase, no 
              matter bow suitable for combination its elements might be from a 
              grammatical standpoint.&#8221; They&#8217; then go on to explain 
              that:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obtuse angles require a slowing and steadying 
                of the band in their execution, and are, therefore, stenographically 
                objectionable in themselves. In the building of outlines of <em>words</em> 
                the obtuse angle must at times be submitted to; but in <em>phrase-writing</em> 
                it is generally avoidable and to be avoided. It should be observed 
                also that the difficulty of an obtuse-angle joining of a half-length 
                stroke is greater than is that of full length stroke, while the 
                joining of the ticks, <em>a-an-and</em>, the, and of the vowel 
                logograms at an obtuse angle is still more objectionable.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another author, Mr. D. P. Lindsley, declared:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When an angle must be formed, the more acute 
                it is the more easily can it be made. Obtuse angles are especially 
                <em>objectionable</em>, <em>and should be avoided as much as possible</em>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. W. S. Rogers, author of &#8220;Lessons 
              in Graham Shorthand,&#8221; says:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We really have but two easy joinings, and 
                those are strokes joined by circles or by sharp angles. Strokes 
                joined by obtuse angles are more likely to detract from speed 
                than add to it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the Introduction of &#8220;A Critical and 
              Historical Account of the Art of Shorthand,&#8221; the authors (Hugh 
              W. limes and George Carl Mares) say:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The obtuse joining is altogether condemnable, 
                seeing that in writing performed with even a moderate degree of 
                haste, it is liable to be rounded off and the two strokes appear 
                as a single curve.<sup><a href="basicp05.shtml#1">1</a></sup> 
                A system in which obtuse angles occur frequently would prove untrustworthy.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The famous reporter, and foremost exponent 
              of Isaac Pitman Shorthand in England, Thomas Allen Reed, in &#8220;Leaves 
              from my Note-Book,&#8221; in explaining the nature of various phrases, 
              said, &#8220;The easiest joinings are those of straight lines or 
              <em>curves</em> that run into one another. Right angles and obtuse 
              angles are less easy. Unless the junction is easy and flowing, no 
              time is saved; indeed it will often take less time to write such 
              words separately than without lifting the pen.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>An Insoluble Problem.</strong> &#8212; 
              After I left Mr. Pettigrew I could not get his argument about the 
              obtuse angles out of my mind. A little later, when the combination 
              and curvilinear principles became fixed tenets in my shorthand creed, 
              Mr. Pettigrew&#8217;s denunciation of the obtuse angles seemed to 
              intrude itself in every experiment. When I was happy over some arrangement 
              of the characters for an alphabet I would find an obtuse angle; 
              and immediately there would flash into my mind a picture of Alderman 
              Pettigrew leaning over the counter of his shop in Sauchiehall Street, 
              pointing the finger of scorn at the offending angle! There were 
              no obtuse angles in longhand &#8212; I was forced to acknowledge 
              that&#8212;and if the &#8220;system of the future,&#8221; of which 
              I dreamed, and for which I worked, was to be the &#8220;distilled 
              essence of our common writing,&#8221; obtuse angles must be eliminated. 
              There seemed no way to eliminate them except by providing alternative 
              signs for the letters, as suggested by Mr. Pettigrew, and where 
              were sufficient signs for alternatives to be obtained in a script-hand 
              system? Seemingly it was an insoluble problem, and I was utterly 
              discouraged over it.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The Solution Discovered.</strong> &#8212; 
              Then, one day came this thought: if lines which join with an obtuse 
              angle take on the appearance of large curves when the angle is obscured 
              in rapid writing, why is it not possible to contrive combinations 
              with that end in view? Why not arrange the horizontal and upward 
              lines so that when they blend in the form of curves these curves 
              shall represent very frequent combinations of letters?<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I well remember the enthusiasm and the feverish 
              energy &#8216;with which I worked day and night on that idea&#8212;how 
              I compiled table after table of all the common combinations of letters, 
              and tested each of them. I realized that it was not enough to have 
              conceived the theory: I must apply it to the most useful purpose. 
              The result you know: the <em>ten</em>, <em>den</em>, <em>tem</em>, 
              <em>ent</em>, <em>emt</em>, blends; and <em>def</em>, <em>dev</em>, 
              <em>jent</em>, <em>jend</em> (the latter afterwards extended to 
              <em>pent</em>, <em>pend</em>).<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>The &#8220;Blends.&#8221;</strong> &#8212; 
              In presenting the &#8220;Blended Consonants&#8221; in the first 
              editions they were arranged in two groups:<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1) The combinations <em>pr</em>, <em>pl</em>, 
              <em>br</em>, <em>bl</em>, <em>kr</em>, <em>kl</em>, <em>gr</em>, 
              <em>gl</em>, <em>ted</em>, <em>ded</em>, <em>ses</em>, all of which 
              combine without an angle. (<em>Fr</em>, <em>fl</em>, <em>vr</em>, 
              <em>vl</em>, were added later).<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2) The combinations in which the obtuse angle 
              was eliminated through the &#8220;natural tendency of the hand to 
              allow such lines to form a curve&#8221;&#8212;<em>ten</em>, <em>den</em>, 
              <em>tem</em>, <em>dem</em>, <em>ent</em>, <em>end</em>, <em>emd</em>, 
              <em>def</em>, <em>dev</em>, <em>jent</em> (the last named being 
              afterwards extended to <em>pent</em>, <em>pend</em>).<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the inclusion of the combinations given 
              in the first section helped to emphasize the fact that combination 
              was a basic principle in the system, it was not necessary to make 
              a special feature of them, as the characters joined without the 
              application of any special blending principle. For this reason I 
              thought it advisable in later editions to introduce them without 
              special classification in order that students might have a more 
              extensive writing vocabulary early in the course.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The little &#8220;wave-like&#8221; <em>ses</em> 
              has always been a great favorite with writers; there was nothing 
              just like it in any system prior to &#8220;Light-Line,&#8221; but 
              it has been adopted in several systems since then.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The joining of <em>t</em> to <em>d</em> to express 
              <em>ted</em>, <em>ded</em>, is an old expedient used in many other 
              systems.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It may interest many writers of the system to 
              learn that the sign for <em>men</em>, <em>mem</em>, was not in the 
              system at first. At that time <em>ng</em> was expressed by the sign 
              now used for <em>men</em>, <em>mem</em>, and <em>nk</em> was expressed 
              by the lowered <em>n</em>. Later the lowered <em>n</em> was assigned 
              to <em>ng</em>, which was lengthened for <em>nk</em> (<em>ngk</em>). 
              This change permitted the use of the lengthened <em>m</em> for <em>men</em>, 
              <em>mem</em>, and thus one of the most useful of all the combinations 
              was added to the system. Isaac Pitman, in an address before the 
              Shorthand Society, London, 1894, said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>M</em> and <em>n</em> are not only side 
                by side in the alphabet, but like loving sisters they walk through 
                the language hand in hand. These affinities must be regarded in 
                the selection of signs to represent the sounds, so that the letters 
                may run easily into each other as the sounds do.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It will be seen that the dictum of the author 
              of Phonography applies more strongly to the representation of <em>n</em> 
              and <em>m</em> in Gregg Shorthand than it does to his own system.<br />
              It is certainly remarkable how frequently <em>n</em> follows <em>m</em>, 
              and how seldom it precedes it. The saving effected by expressing 
              such common combinations as <em>men</em>, <em>mem</em>, by one impulse 
              of the pen is very obvious.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>As a Matter of Record. </strong>&#8212; 
              An attempt has been made to show that the blending principle was 
              not original with &#8220;Light-Line Phonography.&#8221; This is 
              highly complimentary, because it shows that the great value of the 
              elimination of the obtuse angle, and the resulting combinations 
              (one is tempted to say, &#8220;thus killing two birds with one stone&#8221;) 
              is fully recognized even by those opposed to the system. In attempting 
              to substantiate his assertion our critic points to arbitrary signs 
              for combinations of letters, such as have appeared in systems since 
              the beginning of shorthand, and which are in no sense blended signs.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In view of these misstatements I may be pardoned 
              if I make a digression at this point to state that so far as I am 
              aware:<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) The blending of the obtuse angles in the 
              form of curves is not to be found in any previous system.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) The curves representing the blends in our 
              system <em>are not used in the alphabet for any purpose</em>. Therefore 
              it is obvious that the blending principle was a fundamental part 
              of the construction of the alphabet, and not an afterthought.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) The name, &#8220;Blended Consonants,&#8221; 
              was not used in other systems until <em>after</em> the appearance 
              of &#8220;Light-Line Phonography.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) In borrowing the name, &#8220;Blended Consonants,&#8221; 
              from &#8220;Light-Line&#8221; as a substitute for the names previously 
              used&#8212;&#8220; syllabic contractions,&#8221; &#8220;consonantal 
              combinations,&#8221; &#8220;combined consonants,&#8221; etc.&#8212;to 
              designate contractions which are not obtained by allpwing lines 
              forming an obtuse angle to blend as curves, other systems have perpetrated 
              a ridiculous solecism. Webster&#8217;s New International Dictionary 
              defines &#8220;blend&#8221; in this way:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To fuse, merge . . . to pass or shade imperceptibly 
                into one another . . . so that it cannot be known where one ends 
                and the other begins.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Century Dictionary defines it:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To cause to pass imperceptibly into one another; 
                to unite so that there shall be no perceptible line of division.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How admirably this describes the elimination 
              of the obtuse angle by the arrangement of the letters, so that they 
              pass &#8220;into one another&#8221; in the form of a large curve 
              &#8220;without any perceptible line of division&#8221; will be apparent 
              to any reader who is familiar with the system. And it will be equally 
              apparent that the name &#8220;Blended Consonants,&#8221; when applied 
              to arbitrary combinations of consonantal characters which join with 
              a sharp angle, and cannot therefore &#8220;pass imperceptibly into 
              one another,&#8221; is a misnomer.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps I have written at too great length on 
              this subject. In coming to the explanation of this subject I found 
              a reminiscent pleasure, as it were, in recalling my boyish enthusiasm 
              and exultation over the discovery of the blending principle. In 
              those days it was an epic event! And in all the years that have 
              passed since then I have not had any reason to change my views about 
              its importance. Indeed, I would be wanting in frankness if I did 
              not acknowledge that the Blended Consonants have given me greater 
              satisfaction than any other basic principle of the system, except 
              Curvilinear Motion, of which it is a natural and logical development.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<sup>1<a name="1" id="1"></a></sup> The similarity 
              in the wording of this to our presentation of the blending principle 
              will be noted. It was published nine years after Light-Line Phonography, 
              hence the unconscious assimilation.</p>

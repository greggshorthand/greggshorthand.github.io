              TALK WITH THE BEGINNER </strong></div>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Success in any study depends largely upon 
              the <em>interest</em> taken in that particular subject by the student. 
              This being the case, we earnestly hope that you will realize at 
              the very outset that shorthand can be made an intensely fascinating 
              study. Cultivate a love for it. Think of it as the highest form 
              of writing, which is itself the greatest invention of humanity. Be proud 
              that you can record the language in graceful lines and curves. Aim 
              constantly to acquire artistic skill in executing those lines and 
              curves. You <em>can</em>, if you <em>will</em>, make the study of 
              shorthand a perfect joy instead of a task. Skill in the use of shorthand 
              is a possession that has been coveted by the wisest of men and women, 
              for it is not only a practical instrument in commercial work, but 
              a much-prized and valuable accomplishment and a means of mental 
              culture.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Be Thorough.</strong> Skill in anything 
              is attained by repetition with interest; therefore do not shirk 
              the careful, painstaking practice on the elementary forms given 
              in the Manual. Write each outline many times, and aim always at 
              the attainment of fluency and exactness in execution.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your future success depends to a very large 
              extent on the way you do your work now. In order that your progress 
              may be sure and rapid, master each lesson before you proceed with 
              the next.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In your practice, write as rapidly as you can 
              while keeping the hand under complete control; aim at accuracy rather 
              than speed, but do not <em>draw</em> the characters. You must understand 
              at the outset that shorthand must be <em>written</em>; but you must 
              also impress upon your mind that whatever you write you must read, 
              hence the necessity for good penmanship. As skill in executing the 
              movements is obtained, the speed may be increased until the forms 
              can be written accurately at a high rate of speed. Some attention 
              should be given to acquiring a capacity for writing <em>individual</em> 
              outlines rapidly without hesitation, and with a free movement of 
              the hand.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Aim to acquire a smooth style of writing; execute 
              each character with an easy, continuous motion of the pen, and pass 
              directly to the next without unnecessary movements. A halting, jerky 
              movement is fatal to speed, and may be almost always traced to indecision, 
              caused by unfamiliaritY with the forms. At first carefully analyze 
              the words. To do this it is, of course, necessary for you to think 
              of them in detail; but after you have determined the correct outline, 
              practice it and think of it as a whole.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Facility in the practical use of shorthand depends 
              largely upon the stock of outlines you have at your ready command. 
              Note the use of that word &#8220;ready.&#8221; This means that you 
              should master all the forms given in the Manual by writing them 
              many times. This will not only impress the forms on your mind, so 
              that you will not have any hesitation in recalling them, but will 
              give you facility in writing them. In shorthand it is not sufficient 
              to know how to write a word you must not only know the form but 
              be able to write it quickly. Hence the necessity for much repetition 
              practice in writing the forms.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most of this repetition practice should be on 
              the forms as they occur naturally in connected matter. The repetition 
              of isolated forms for more than five times consecutively is not 
              in accord with modern pedagogy. Scientifically graded connected 
              matter has supplanted the isolated form.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If, in addition to the words given in the Manual, 
              you can add to your stock of outlines other words written under 
              the same principles, you will have gained a great deal will have 
              laid a broader foundation for advanced work which will lessen the 
              time required to attain efficiency.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Devote Much Time to Reading Well-Written 
              Shorthand.</strong> By reading a great deal of well-written shorthand 
              you will become not only a fluent reader, but you will enlarge your 
              writing vocabulary. Unconsciously you will imitate in your own work 
              the easy execution of the forms shown in the printed plates. All 
              expert writers have devoted much time to reading shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the work outlined in this Manual, 
              we strongly recommend the use of the supplementary dictation material 
              given in &#8220;Gregg Speed Studies,&#8221; and the exercises presented 
              each month in the Learner&#8217;s Department of <em>The Gregg Writer</em>. 
              These exercises may be used with great advantage from the very first 
              lesson. Each number of <em>The Gregg Writer</em> contains many helpful 
              suggestions and a number of shorthand pages that afford valuable 
              exercises in reading and writing for students at all stages of advancement.</p>

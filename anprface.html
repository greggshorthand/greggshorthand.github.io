            </div>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone who examines the Shorthand textbooks 
              of the last three centuries will be impressed with the fact that 
              they have reflected the uses to which shorthand was put at the time 
              the books were written.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pedagogy of shorthand has changed as radically 
              as the content of the textbooks. Up to the time Gregg Shorthand 
              was introduced, the conventional pedagogy was to teach the theory 
              of a system as a whole before attempting to apply the theory in 
              the actual writing of connected matter. While the system would undoubtedly 
              have made its way into public favor by its own inherent strength, 
              we believe that its success and progress throughout the world have 
              been hastened enormously by the teachability of its textbooks <br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In keeping with the progress in business and 
              in education, the Gregg Manual was revised in 1893, 1901, and 1916, 
              this latter edition being the one used at present. Each revision 
              marked a step forward in simplifying and popularizing the study 
              of shorthand. Each revision has placed increasing emphasis upon 
              the desirability of teaching shorthand as a skill subject from the 
              beginning and throughout the entire course. This method enables 
              the teacher to direct the maximum of effort toward the training 
              of the student in actual facility in writing and the minimum of 
              effort to expositions of rules and principles.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When it became known that a revision of the 
              Manual was in preparation, hundreds of protests were received from 
              teachers Many of them declared emphatically that the 1916 edition 
              was entirely adequate. A great many said that they &#8220;love it&#8221; 
              (this expression occurs again and again in their letters) and that 
              they &#8220;know it by heart.&#8221; The sentiments expressed are 
              thoroughly appreciated, and all these good friends are assured that 
              it will still be possible to obtain the 1916 edition as long as 
              there is any demand for it.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this new edition no changes have been made 
              in the basic principles of the system. Long experience in the classroom, 
              in the office, in general and court reporting, and the results of 
              speed contests of the National Shorthand Reporters&#8217; Association 
              have proved conclusively that changes in the basic principles of 
              Gregg Shorthand are neither necessary nor desirable.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Much has been learned in the last few years 
              concerning the basic content of the vocabulary in common use. The 
              scientific data now available have made it possible to arrange the 
              principles and practice content of the Manual so chat the efforts 
              of teacher and student may be more economically and profitably directed, 
              and the development of a writing vocabulary rendered more rapid.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the first steps in planning the Anniversary 
              Edition, therefore, was an exhaustive analysis of the words contained 
              in the Horn<a href="anprface.shtml#one">*</a> and the Harvard<a href="anprface.shtml#two">&#8224;</a> 
              studies of the comparative frequency of words. As one example of 
              what this analysis showed, it was found that the learning of the 
              twenty most common words- in our language was spread through seven 
              lessons in the 1916 Manual. In the Anniversary Edition these twenty 
              words are presented in the first chapter. Moreover, the matter presented 
              in this chapter gives the student a writing power that will enable 
              him to write 42 per cent of the running words in non-technical English, 
              as well as many hundreds of other words.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this edition three devices have been used 
              to hasten the building of a useful vocabulary and to assist the 
              teacher in using the correct method of developing a skill subject:<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. The short words of high frequency are introduced 
              in the first chapter in the order of their frequency, even though 
              this means that in a few instances they are given in advance of 
              the principles that govern their writing.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Some of the principles have been developed 
              earlier than they were in the old text. Examples of this are: the 
              letter <em>s</em> has been introduced in the second chapter and 
              included with the other downward characters; some of the rules for 
              expressing <em>r</em> have been introduced in the third chapter; 
              the frequently recurring prefixes and suffixes have been introduced 
              in the order of frequency<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. Analogy, one of the most helpful of teaching 
              devices, has been employed to a greater extent than it was in the 
              1916 Manual. Examples: the useful <em>ted-ded</em>, <em>men-mem</em> 
              blends are presented in Chapter I, after the student has learned 
              <em>t</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>n</em>, <em>rn</em>, the letters of 
              which the blends are composed; the <em>ses</em> blend is taught 
              along with the <em>s</em> in Chapter II.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other salient features of the Anniversary Edition 
              may be described as follows:<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. In order that the student may be impressed 
              at the outset with the importance of phrase writing and have a longer 
              period in which to acquire the habit of joining words, many of the 
              phrasing principles have been moved forward to Chapters I and II.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. The rules have been simplified and stated 
              more clearly,, and minor changes have been made in a few outlines&#8217; 
              for the purpose of facilitating rapid and accurate transcription.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. The principles are presented in twelve chapters, 
              instead of the twenty lessons in the 1916 Manual. Each of these 
              chapters has been subdivided into three short teaching units, with 
              a page of graded dictation material written in shorthand at the 
              end of each unit. This short-unit plan encourages immediate practical 
              application of the theory and simplifies the assignment of work 
              by the teacher.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. The wordsigns (now known as Brief Forms) 
              are distributed equally among the first six chapters, and are introduced 
              in the order of their frequency.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. The quantity of reading and dictation material 
              has been more than doubled. The scientific distribution of the principles 
              and the introduction of the common words early have so greatly increased 
              writing power that business letters can be introduced as early as 
              the second chapter.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. The pedagogical value of the Manual is greatly 
              enhanced by the use of larger type and a bolder style of shorthand 
              than was employed in the 1916 edition.<br />
              It was the intention of the author to have the Anniversary Edition 
              of the system published last year the fortieth anniversary of the 
              publication of the system but, unfortunately, many things contributed 
              to delay its appearance.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In sending forth this book he desires to express 
              his warm appreciation of the many suggestions received from writers, 
              from reporters, and from teachers who are using the system in all 
              parts of the world. In particular, he wishes to record his deep 
              sense of gratitude to Mr. Rupert P. SoRelle and to the executive, 
              managerial, and editorial staffs of The Gregg Publishing Company 
              for the many valuable services they have rendered in the preparation 
              of this edition.</p>

              <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a name="p233" id="p233"></a><strong>233.</strong> 
                &nbsp;Since there is no context to initials, writing them accurately 
                is very important.</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/gregg233.gif" alt="Initials" width="381" height="248" /></p>
              <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><a name="p234" id="p234"></a>234.</strong> 
                &nbsp;Many writers prefer to write initials in longhand, and if 
                this is done, a great saving in time may be effected by writing 
                them in small letters and joining the letters, thus:</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/gregg234.gif" alt="Use of longhand letters for initials" width="339" height="69" /></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Intersection</strong></p>
              <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><a name="p235" id="p235"></a>235.</strong> 
                &nbsp;The expedient known as intersection, or the writing of one 
                character through another, is sometimes useful for special phrases. 
                &nbsp;In applying this expedient the writer must rely very heavily 
                upon his own judgment. &nbsp;In his daily work as a stenographer 
                or reporter, he may find some terms peculiar to the business in 
                which he works occurring so frequently that special forms may 
                be adopted for them that will be brief and yet absolutely distinctive. 
                &nbsp;Very often the writing of one character through another 
                will meet the exigency. &nbsp;The following are useful examples:</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="images/gregg235.gif" alt="Use of intersection" width="433" height="868" /></p>
              <p align="center"><strong><a name="p236" id="p236"></a>236.&nbsp;

              <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. It transpired that he did 
                not aspire to the office himself but was conspiring to overthrow 
                the incumbent.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Intensive study of the actual conditions 
                of the conflict ought to make it possible to prevent the recurrence 
                of this emergency.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. Without a considerable body of experimental 
                data it is impossible to formulate physiological rules with reliability.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4 In the extremity, the sublimity and nobility 
                of his character were revealed with inspiring clarity.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. The floods were a national calamity in 
                which thousands were injured, to say nothing of the financial 
                losses inflicted on all the people in that territory.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. It will probably require the services of 
                many stenographers to answer all the inquiries about the branches 
                of this extensive business, and I myself shall take care of those 
                of great urgency.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7. One of the finest things a teacher can 
                do is to inspire the student to make proper use of his leisure 
                time, to give some time to reflection and thought<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8. Nobility of thought, adaptability of ideas, 
                and generosity of nature&#8212;these are the fundamental requisites 
                for those who would have the real rewards of life.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9. His phraseology seems to call for an apology 
                on his part; the other members of the partnership were not backward 
                in sending him a notification to that effect<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10. He employed all his great ability in writing 
                an interesting article on the politics of this locality. As he 
                wrote with authority, and had every justification for what he 
                said, his article had a certain degree of popularity with the 
                majority.</p>

            <blockquote style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has finally become the experience 
              of the most expert shorthand writers that outlines which depend 
              upon shading for their legibility are in general unsafe outlines 
              to adopt.<br />
              <div style="text-align: right">&#8212;George H. Thornton</div>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It does not seem 
              necessary to argue that it takes longer to write a heavy stroke 
              than a light one. The fact is so obvious that I was inclined to 
              depart from the plan of giving quotations from authors and prominent 
              advocates of other systems in support of any statement I made. My 
              files contain a folder for each shorthand principle, and the one 
              devoted to shading is simply overflowing with articles and quotations 
              about the evils of shading. Many of the articles give numerous instances 
              of humorous&#8212;and sometimes serious&#8212;errors in transcription 
              which have been caused by the use of shading.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>An Obstacle to Speed.</strong> &#8212; 
              To be consistent with the plan of the series of articles, I am going 
              to incorporate a few quotations. The first one is from a book published 
              by Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, called &#8220;Phonography in the Office.&#8221; 
              The author, Mr. Kingston, deplores a &#8220;too heavy style of shorthand,&#8221; 
              as &#8220;the increased friction from the resistance of the paper 
              makes it a serious obstacle to the acquisition of speed, to say 
              nothing of the difficulty of distinguishing thin and thick strokes.&#8221; 
              He then gives an exercise &#8220;so framed as to consist almost 
              exclusively of light curves,&#8221; stating that the &#8220;selection 
              of words and phrases which favor a continuous, flowing style of 
              writing will enable the writer to take it down easily.&#8221; After 
              giving the selection consisting &#8220; almost exclusively of light 
              curves,&#8221; he utters this significant warning:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rate of speed required in the writing 
                of such a passage will be much greater than upon an ordinary passage, 
                and it must not be used as a test of speed, or the result will 
                be very misleading.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some years ago 
              a well-known Chicago law reporter, Mr. W. E. McDermut, in writing 
              on the subject of shading, said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Forty years ago Mr. Graham tabulated the 
                results of experiments made to test the relative brevity of certain 
                characters and combinations. His tables showed that light characters 
                are at least ten per cent more rapid than heavy ones. I have demonstrated 
                with shorthand classes that this is the minimum difference, and 
                some writers claim that the advantage of light strokes amounts 
                to thirty per cent.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his &#8220;Handbook 
              of Standard Phonography&#8221; (Edition of 1858, Part V., p. 12), 
              Mr. Graham said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The difference between <em>t</em> and <em>d</em> 
                shows that it is a disadvantage to write with a heavy hand&#8212;that 
                the heavy lines should be barely distinguished from the light 
                lines, which should be made very light.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Isaac S. Dement, 
              the winner of the first reporters&#8217; speed contest in the United 
              States, said after the contest (<em>Phonographic World</em>, September, 
              1887):</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wish also to say here that I think this 
                light-line system is the true one, and will be thoroughly demonstrated 
                to be the true one in time.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">In the preface to the&#8221; Modern 
              Stenographer,&#8221; Mr. George H. Thornton, former president of 
              the New York State Stenographers&#8217; Association and official 
              reporter of the Supreme Court, New York, said:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has finally become the experience of the 
                most expert stenographers that outlines which depend upon shading 
                for their legibility are in general unsafe outlines to adopt. 
                . . . If, as experience has taught, this shading of the outlines 
                can be done away with, it is useless to tell a practical stenographer 
                of the immense advantage in point of speed to be gained thereby. 
                . . . The essence of this principle is recognized by Mr. Munson 
                in his &#8220;Complete Phonographer,&#8221; for he there says 
                that increase of speed is attended with decrease of force, and 
                therefore that all stems would be written as light as consistent 
                with legibility. If this is true, the converse of the proposition 
                most naturally follows, that the increase of force necessarily 
                required in the shading of the outlines must be attended with 
                decrease of speed. It is so apparent that a plain system can be 
                written with a greatly increased rapidity that it is hardly worth 
                while to demonstrate it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Correct 
              Shading Essential.</strong> &#8212; The <em>Phonographic Magazine</em>, 
              Cincinnati, Ohio (the organ of the Benn Pitman system) for May, 
              1889, has this frank admission:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Undoubtedly, there are many outlines which 
                are recognizable from their general form without reference to 
                shading&#8212;with the shading omitted, or even with the shaded 
                and light strokes reversed. But such outlines are relatively few, 
                and are only the forms of long words or of highly characteristic 
                phrases. Thousands of words and phrases of only one and two strokes 
                depend upon correct shading not only for ready legibility, but 
                for a degree of legibility which enables the writer to read them 
                at all.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In answer to a 
              question from a correspondent who experienced difficulty in shading 
              horizontal strokes&#8212;and he is not alone in that!&#8212;the 
              <em>Phonographic Magazine</em> (October, 1904) gave the following 
              elaborate suggestions:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify"> 
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ordinary normal position of the hand 
                in phonographic writing is such that both nibs of the pen may 
                rest upon the paper with equal pressure. In shading horizontal 
                strokes this position may be temporarily modified by very slightly 
                rotating the penholder with the downward pressure of the thumb, 
                so that the left nib shall press a little more heavily than the 
                right nib. As soon as the stroke is executed, however, a contrary 
                rotation of the penholder should bring the pen back to the normal 
                position. Your only danger in carrying this hint into practice 
                is that you may make the rotation of the holder and the consequent 
                pressure on the left nib greater than necessary. The modification 
                of the normal position should be very slight, indeed.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These quotations 
              are from authors or expert writers of Pitmanic systems. In these 
              systems shading is used chiefly as a means of distinction between 
              the phonetic pairs, although as Mr. Hugh limes has pointed out, 
              &#8220;Pitman shades not only to distinguish similar consonants, 
              but to add <em>p</em> to <em>m</em>, <em>r</em> to <em>l</em>, <em>ch</em> 
              to <em>r</em>, and to give <em>n</em> a nasal intonation.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Shading Used for Many Purposes. </strong>&#8212; 
              Shading has been used for many purposes in various systems. It has 
              been used to express double letters; to add consonants, such as 
              h, r, s, t; to add vowels; and to distinguish shades of vowel sounds. 
              In the German systems it is generally used &#8220;to distinguish 
              symbolically-indicated vowels, and also certain written vowels.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far back as 1856 Soper thickened letters 
              to add <em>r</em>, calling it &#8220;the simultaneous <em>r</em>.&#8221; 
              He was followed in this by J. G. Cross (1878), who called it &#8220;the 
              coalescent <em>r</em>,&#8221; by Sloan (1882), Simson (1884), Barter 
              and others. In Guest&#8217;s &#8220;Compendious Shorthand&#8221; 
              thickening is used to add <em>t</em> or <em>d</em>, and lengthening 
              is used to add <em>s</em>. It is usually claimed on behalf of systems 
              in which shading is used for the purpose of adding a letter that 
              this is an advantage, because they have less shading than in the 
              Pitman system.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most prominent of the systems applying shading 
              for the addition of a letter is the Sloan-Duployan. There was no 
              shading in the original French system, but as the outlines were 
              very cumbrous, Mr. Shan, following the lead of Soper and Cross, 
              introduced shading to express the letter <em>r</em>.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Shading Denounced by Those Who Use It.</strong> 
              &#8212; A pamphlet on behalf of Sloan-Duployan Shorthand, entitled 
              &#8220;Revolution in Shorthand&#8221; (written and copyrighted by 
              Mr. Thomas S. Malone, then the Glasgow agent for SloanDuployan and 
              who later became identified with &#8220;Script Phonography&#8221;) 
              claims that one of &#8220;the leading principles of structure from 
              which the system derives its chief excellence&#8221; is &#8220;the 
              absence of shading, or the use of light and heavy signs, which is 
              only introduced by Mr. Sloan into his adaptation to meet a peculiarity 
              of the English language with regard to one particular letter of 
              constant recurrence.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then follows this succinct statement of the 
              evils of shading:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The extensive 
                use of the process of shading outlines, although very general 
                in the old systems, is a most objectionable principle in shorthand, 
                being an obstruction of speed if used, and a source of illegibility 
                if neglected.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the same paragraph 
              the &#8220;monstrous &#8216;position&#8217; principle in other systems, 
              which gives to an outline a variety of meanings according to its 
              position on the paper&#8221; is denounced. But, in the words of 
              Kipling, that is another story.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even more effective is the argument against 
              shading contained in the &#8220;Reply to T. A. Reed&#8217;s Criticism 
              of SloanDuployan Shorthand,&#8221; written by Mr. Malone, and published 
              by the Sloan-Duployan Shorthand Association. The &#8220;Reply &#8220; 
              says:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After describing 
                the alphabet he [Mr. Reed] remarks: &nbsp;&#8220;Nor do I find 
                fault with the distinction between the two letters in each pair 
                by length, although a good deal is lost in brevity by the absence 
                of any distinction in thickness.&#8221; However high may be Mr. 
                Reed&#8217;s reputation as a shorthand writer, we unhesitatingly 
                assert that here he utters a palpable fallacy obvious to the merest 
                tyro in the art.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That the absence of any distinction in <em>thickness 
                of stroke acclerates</em> instead of <em>retarding</em> speed 
                is a plain matter of fact, which it will require something more 
                than the weight of Mr. Reed&#8217;s authority to controvert. Let 
                the reader try the simple experiment of tracing the following 
                two pairs of lines&#8212;the one distinguished by length and the 
                other by thickness&#8212;and then judge of the soundness of the 
                theory Mr. Reed gravely propounds. The former pair, it will be 
                seen, in striking contrast to the eye are equally expeditious 
                to the hand, while the latter necessitates the shading&#8212;a 
                process most obstructive to rapid writing. Great indeed must be 
                the blinding power of self-interest if so able a man as Mr. Reed 
                can persuade himself that the absence of shading in a shorthand 
                system is a defect.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And on the same 
              page Mr. Malone, in speaking of some of the Duployan outlines, said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As they are free 
                from shading and scarcely involve the principle of position, the 
                facility with which they can be applied is self-evident.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In his first lecture

              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our next source of speed is the light, hair-stroke 
                character of the writing, there being no shading, no thickening 
                of the strokes, except with regard to one letter, and that the 
                most common letter in the language, the letter s and, of course, 
                its cognate <em>z</em> (or soft <em>s</em>).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a characteristic confusion of ideas 
              in this statement. Mr. Malone begins by claiming as a great merit 
              of &#8220;Script Phonography&#8221; that there is little shading, 
              and then goes on to say that shading is used for the &#8220;<em>most 
              common letter in the language!</em>&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the appearance of &#8220;Light-Line Phonography 
              &#8220;&#8212; a system in which there was absolutely no shading 
              &#8212; Mr. Malone made a&#8221; strategical retreat,&#8221; in 
              these words:</p>
            <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
              <p>To the thoughtless and indolent, the total absence of any distinction 
                between thick and thin lines in a system of shorthand may seem 
                an attraction by the license afforded for dispensing with all 
                discipline of hand movement and concentration of thought. To write 
                in a slipshod, mechanical manner, without having to think appeals 
                to some as a thing to be desired.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My only comment 
              on this is to repeat Mr. Malone&#8217;s reference to Mr. Reed&#8212;&#8220;Great 
              indeed must be the blinding power of self-interest.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Shading Always Detrimental.</strong> 
              &#8212; Shading is objectionable in whatever form it is used. It 
              is more objectionable as an expedient for adding a letter (as in 
              Sloan-Duployan, Script, Cross, etc.) than when it is used to distinguish 
              between the phonetic pairs, as in the Pitman system. When it is 
              used to distinguish the phonetic pairs, if the shading is not clear 
              there is sometimes a slight clue to the word on account of the similarity 
              of sounds. It is true, as stated in the quotation from the <em>Phonographic 
              Magazine</em> already given, that &#8220;such outlines are relatively 
              few, and are only the forms of long words or of highly characteristic 
              phrases.&#8221; But it does happen occasionally. In the case of 
              systems where shading is used to add an important letter, if the 
              shading is not clearly indicated, there is absolutely no indication 
              that a letter is omitted.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The difficulty in some of these systems is intensified 
              by the fact that the shading is applied to <em>upstrokes</em>, and 
              even to <em>small circles and hooks</em>! Where an attempt is made 
              to apply shading to minute characters, such as circles and hooks, 
              the onward impulse of the pen is <em>checked abruptly</em> while 
              the pressure is being applied to the minute character. After an 
              abrupt pause of that kind it is difficult to regain momentum, just 
              as it would be impossible for a runner to stop every hundred yards 
              to pick up something and keep going at his maximum speed. The difficulty 
              of applying shading to a small circle or hook, even when writing 
              at a moderate speed, will be apparent to everyone; but when the 
              writing is <em>rapid</em> it is almost impossible to apply shading 
              to minute characters.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are many systems in which <em>both</em> 
              position-writing and shading are used to add consonants. When either 
              of these hazardous expedients is not applied with precision, the 
              reading of the notes depends upon the guessing ability of the reader; 
              but when <em>both</em> expedients are applied to the <em>same character</em>, 
              and neither applied with precision, the reader of the notes needs 
              to be a super-guesser, so to speak.</p>

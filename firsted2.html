          <td width="79%" colspan="2" class="text"><p align="center"><strong>Preface</strong>.</p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over five years ago Light-Line 
              Phonography was published as &quot;a simple, rapid, and perfectly 
              legible phonetic handwriting for general use.&quot; &nbsp;I began 
              to teach it in a very quiet way, but so great was the enthusiasm 
              of my students, and so remarkable were the results which they achieved, 
              that before six months had elapsed the system was the subject of 
              heated controversy in the public press, and its text-books were 
              selling by the thousand. &nbsp;From that time to the present, Light-Line 
              has had a career of success which, I venture to say, is without 
              a parallel in the history of Shorthand.&nbsp; The system aroused 
              exceptional and widespread interest because it was a complete departure 
              from the old lines, my contention being that it was impossible to 
              make any real advance in that direction. &nbsp;For half a century 
              clever phonographers all over the world have been endeavoring to 
              improve the old method, and their efforts have merely resulted in 
              slight modifications of the original system. &nbsp;If it had been 
              possible to make and <em>real</em> improvement on the old lines 
              it would have been made long ago by Messrs. Graham, Munson, Longley 
              and the host of other adapters of Isaac Pitman's Phonography. &nbsp;I 
              believe that the trend of Shorthand progress is towards a more complete 
              identity with our ordinary longhand writing, which in its adaptability 
              to the hand embodies the wisdom of ages. &nbsp;Holding that view, 
              I have admitted no characters into the alphabet which are not to 
              be found in ordinary writing. &nbsp;In this there is a great and 
              obvious advantage, for at the very outset of his study the student 
              is able to utilize the practice he has had in writing longhand, 
              and is relieved of the drudgery of training the hand to <span style="font-size: 8pt">DRAW</span>, 
              with mechanical accuracy, unfamiliar characters in all possible 
              directions. &nbsp;But the advantage does not end there, for as the 
              writer becomes expert he finds that in rapid writing mental strain 
              inseparable from the zig-zag motion of systems founded on the old 
              geometrical system can have no conception of the easy flow which 
              is imparted to the writing by the uniformity of movement and the 
              prevalence of curves.</p>

              </ol>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This brief synopsis will suffice to show that 
              my aim has been to adhere to those natural principles which fovern 
              ordinary writing. &nbsp;By a practical combination of these elements 
              as a <em>foundation</em> the system secures to the writer, with 
              very little practice, that perfect command of the characters which 
              is productive of the best results, and which can only be obtained 
              with the old method by years of persistent practice.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is almost needless to say that a faulty allotment 
              of the alphabetic characters would have entirely nullified in practice 
              the value of the natural principles which form the basis of the 
              system. &nbsp;But even a cursory glance at the alphabet will show 
              that <em>T</em>, <em>D</em>, <em>N</em>, <em>M</em> have certain 
              strokes assigned to their representation in order that, by the junction 
              of these strokes in the form of a curve, the common syllables <em>Ten</em>, 
              <em>Den</em>, <em>Tem</em>, <em>Dem</em>, <em>Ent</em>, <em>End</em>, 
              <em>Emt</em>, <em>Emd</em> may each be effectively represented by 
              a single effort of the hand. &nbsp;By this combination another important 
              advantage is gained in the abolition of the obtuse or blunt angle 
              which has always been recognized as an obstacle to swift and accurate 
              writing. &nbsp;So much may be seen at a hasty glance, but a deeper 
              study will prove that the entrie alphabet has been carefully thought 
              out in accordance with the respective values of the leters and signs 
              in combination with each other. &nbsp;For example, the ever-recurring 
              compounds <em>pr</em>, <em>br</em>, <em>pl</em>, <em>bl</em>, <em>kr</em>, 
              <em>kl</em>, <em>gr</em>, <em>gl</em>, <em>fr</em>, <em>fl</em>, 
              <em>rk</em> are each effectively represented by one effort, and 
              the same remark applies to the syllables ses, ted, ded, men, mem, 
              def, den, jent, jend. &nbsp;I invite comparison with the older systems 
              in this respect. &nbsp;Hitherto it has been customary in shorthand 
              systems to deal with these &quot;consonantal diphthongs,&quot; as 
              they have appropriately been termed, by special rules and farfetched 
              devices, with innumerable &quot;exceptions,&quot; and the natural 
              result is that these systems present a bewildering number of possible 
              ways of writing the same word.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The theoretical principles on which the system 
              is founded have been endorsed by the &quot;Stenographic Society 
              of France,&quot; and &quot;The Shorthand Society&quot; of England 
              in October 1801.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In discussions in the public press Light-Line 
              has invariably been victorious. &nbsp;A controversy regarding the 
              system was carried on with great vigor by prominent shorthand experts 
              in the columns of <em>The Bazaar, Exchange and Mart</em>, and lasted 
              for over five months. At the conclusion the editor said:<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-size: xx-small">&quot;The 
              real point at issue, in a nutshell, is: 'Is Light-Line a workable 
              system?' Up to the present the weight of evidence is very much in 
              its favor, for not only has it been pretty conclusively shown to 
              be a practical one, but also that it has fewer complications, and 
              is thus more easily acquired than the older systems formed upon 
              geometric principles.&quot;</span><br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the course of a lengthy controvery regarding 
              shorthand systems in the columns of <em>The Weekly Sun</em> during 
              the past few months the editor Mr. T. P. O'Conner, M. P., made the 
              following remarkable statement:<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-size: xx-small">&quot;I have 
              known very few Pitman writers whose notes could be read by anybody 
              else, and I have known a great many&#8212;including myself&#8212;who 
              found it difficult to read their own notes. It strikes me that the 
              system is best which can be made most like the ordinary longhand. 
              Obviously, the same muscles, the same nerves, the same attitudes, 
              all that conglomeration of causes, open and latent, which provide 
              the preculiarities of one's longhand, will be employed in producing 
              the shorthand. In other words, one will write his shorthand as he 
              does his longhand.&quot;</span><br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have demonstrated again and again that Light-Line 
              can be acquired up to a practical proficiency in a mere fraction 
              of the time demanded by the older methods, and both in the public 
              press and on the platform we have challenged out opponents to compete 
              for results, but so far the challenge has not been taken up. Light-Line 
              has been approved by the English and Scotch Education Departments 
              as a &quot;Specific Subject&quot; for instruction in elementary 
              schools, and the results achieved by boys and girls of from ten 
              to fiteen years of age have been pronouned by headmasters and inspectors 
              as &quot;beyond expectation,&quot; and &quot;without precedent.&quot; 
              As regards speed and legibility the system has been written in a 
              publich hall, before independent examiners (including writers and 
              teachers of Pitman's Phonography) for over six minutes, at the speed 
              of 200 words per minute, and the notes were &quot;_read back without 
              a single error&quot;&#8212;vide_ formal certificate. It is written 
              by hundreds of professional stenographers in all parts of the globe, 
              many of whom have abandoned other systems in its favor.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up to the present the text-books and system 
              have practically remained unchanged, but during the past five years 
              I have devoted a considerable amount of time to carefully testing 
              the various suggestions I have received from experts and teachers, 
              and to working out some ideas of my own with a view to rendering 
              the system a still more efficient instrument for recording rapid 
              utterances. A few of these innovations have appeared in the pages 
              of our magazine, but this treatise incorporates not only those which 
              have thus appeared, but many others which have proved of value in 
              practical work. The text-book has been almost entirely re-written, 
              the lessons have been re-arranged, the examples carefully chosen, 
              and I believe it will be found a great improvement on preceding 
              issues and much more suitable both for class work and home study. 
              It will be published simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic, 
              and judging from the way in which the system is spreading, and the 
              large number of professional teachers and reporters who are abandoning 
              the older methods in its favor, it appears destined in the near 
              future to become T<span style="font-size: xx-small">HE </span>S<span style="font-size: xx-small">HORTHAND

              Series 90 Gregg Shorthand<br />
              </strong><em>Ninth edition</em><br />
              (1978-1987)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This version of shorthand was even 
              simpler than the ones before it. &nbsp;Experts felt and McGraw-Hill 
              realized later that it might have gotten too simple. &nbsp;By this 
              time, shorthand had become fairly rare and this version pushed it 
              even farther into that category. &nbsp;Users of it rarely could 
              ever break 100 words per minute.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several principles were removed and 
              great emphasis was placed on making each brief form represent fewer 
              words. &nbsp;Therefore, for instance, <em>doctor</em> and <em>during</em> 
              (<em>d r</em> in all other versions) had to be differenciated from 
              each other. &nbsp;<em>During</em> was changed to the awkward <em>d 
              u r [dot]</em>. &nbsp;<em>By</em> was now written <em>b i</em>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since shorthand was already suffering 
              the problem of application in the modern world, the fact that its 
              results could easily be beaten with alphanumeric systems learnable 
              in a day caused Series 90 to turn the business world off to Gregg 
              Shorthand.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system had already lost its prestige 
              and application in the court reporting world to the stenotype machine. 
              &nbsp;It seemed as if shorthand had no where to be applied.&nbsp; 
              Employers were already typing their own letters; secretaries were 
              already using dictaphones to record dictation and type it at their 
              own paces. The Gregg magazine, <em>Today's Secretary</em>, ended 
              its publication around the beginning of Series 90.</p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series was the least practical 
              and most basic form of shorthand since the 1893 publication, even 
              though the system was still relatively difficult. The brief forms&#8212;<em>advertise</em>, 
              <em>business</em>, <em>between</em>, <em>big</em>, <em>gone</em>, 
              <em>great</em>, <em>how</em>, <em>merchandise</em>, <em>morning</em>, 
              <em>must</em>, <em>purpose</em>, <em>put</em>, <em>railroad</em>, 
              <em>shall</em>, <em>situation</em>, <em>such</em>, <em>those</em>, 
              <em>upon</em>, <em>use</em>, <em>why</em>, and<em> yet</em>&#8212;were 
              removed from the <a href="s90bfs.shtml">brief form list</a> (from 
              Diamond Jubilee). <em>Any</em>, <em>executive</em>, <em>Ms</em>., 
              <em>opinion</em>, <em>responsible</em>, and <em>usual</em> were 
              added to the list.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authors of Gregg Shorthand were 
              not pleased with its decreasing popularity. Even though this was 
              inevitable regardless of the simplicity of the system, they created 
              a new series&#8212;<a href="abcenten.shtml">Gregg Shorthand Centennial 
              Edition</a>.</p>

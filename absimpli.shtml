              Simplified Gregg Shorthand<br />
              </strong><em>Seventh edition</em><strong><br />
              </strong>(1949-1962)</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the average person today, Simplified may 
              be the best series of Gregg Shorthand to learn. &nbsp;Its memory 
              load is low, its speed is not terribly slow, and its manual is still 
              published very well by McGraw-Hill. &nbsp;It is the perfect medium 
              in terms of shorthand learning.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Simplified Series was the first real systematic 
              form of Gregg Shorthand. Anniversary and its predecessors used shortcuts 
              to the discretion of the reporter; but Simplified was the first 
              to teach exactly the brief forms and phrases in those two respective 
              categories, with no allowance for the reporter to use the abbreviation 
              principle. &nbsp;This was the first series of Gregg Shorthand that 
              taught only a few strokes at a time, instead of throwing all the 
              down-strokes or vowels at the pupil at once. This series was very 
              easy for the stenographer to use, and it did not have a deleterious 
              effect on the overall speed of its users. &nbsp;The users of this 
              series could still write more than 150 words per minute with practice.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Simplified has <a href="smpbfs.shtml">181 brief 
              forms</a>, which is the result of combining the most common of the 
              Special Forms and the Brief forms from Anniversary into one list.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the first series that employed the 
              skilful hand and exemplary style of Mr. Charles Rader, the writer 
              of nearly all Simplified textbook shorthand plates (as well as the 
              later versions). &nbsp;His hardly-changing style could even lead 
              people to thinking that the text was automated.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the series began, the new magazine published 
              by the Gregg division of McGraw-Hill, <em>Today's Secretary</em>, 
              used it. &nbsp;With Simplified, there was less emphasis on court 
              reporting, and thus it was becoming a bit more unpopular. &nbsp;One 
              will find very little real literature written in this series. &nbsp;The 
              attention on stenography was already shifting to the world of mechanical 
              methods.</p></td>

              TO THE STUDENT.</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> &nbsp;Write the <em>Sounds</em> 
              of each word and omit all silent letters.&nbsp; Begin by mastering 
              the section of the Alphabet given on page 11, then practise the 
              examples given on pages 12 and 13.&nbsp; When you have gone through 
              all the outlines in the section, test your knowledge by covering 
              up the letterpress and transcribing the shorthand forms, and <em>vice 
              versa</em>. &nbsp;Go through all the lessons in this way, studying 
              each section as you come to it, and you will make much more rapid 
              headway than if you attempt to apply the entire alphabet at the 
              outset.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> &nbsp;Use your common-sense 
              in learning the system. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t follow the old humdrum 
              plan of writing the word in longhand, then the shorthand outline, 
              and afterwards laboriously filling up a regulation space with the 
              shorthand form. &nbsp;Never mind the longhand; write the shorthand 
              only, and repeat the sounds as you write. &nbsp;This will familiarize 
              you with the ordinary process of note taking, and tend to increase 
              your confidence. &nbsp;Note particularly the joinings which give 
              you most trouble and master them thoroughly, for every student has 
              his own peculiar difficulties, and in the absence of a teacher he 
              must rely upon himself to find out what they are and overcome them. 
              &nbsp;If a particular outline in your note-book is not up to the 
              standard given in the hook you should drill that outline until you 
              can write it satisfactorily. &nbsp;Per contra, if you can write 
              a word easily you should pass on to the next without delay as it 
              is manifestly absurd to fill up a regulation space with forms which 
              give you no trouble.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> &nbsp;We keep a register 
              of those who are studying the system and send them, from time to 
              time, intimations of the appearance of fresh publications, the organization 
              of classes or associations, and other matters of interest. &nbsp;Kindly 
              send a note of your address to the head offices, and if you have 
              any difficulty in studying the system write us on the subject, enclosing 
              a stamped envelope for reply. &nbsp;We are always pleased to help 
              students of the system.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> &nbsp;Don&#8217;t stop 
              when you reach the end of P<span style="font-size: xx-small">ART</span> 
              I., as it is not advisable to impress the elementary outlines upon 
              mind, Procure P<span style="font-size: xx-small">ART</span> II.&#8212;T<span style="font-size: xx-small">HE 
              </span>R<span style="font-size: xx-small">EPORTING</span> S<span style="font-size: xx-small">TYLE</span> 
              (price $1)&#8212;which contains an adaptation of the system to verbatim 
              reporting, and is really a continuation of this treatise. &nbsp;For 
              reading and writing practice get &#8220;&AElig;sop&#8217;s Fables&#8221; 
              and the magazine published in the interests of the system.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5.</strong> &nbsp;Above all things 
              keep steadily in mind that the attainment of practical proficiency 
              depends entirely upon yourself&#8212;upon the earnestness and regularity 
              with which you pursue the study&#8212;and that the object in view 
              is worthy of our best efforts admits of no question. Results vary 
              according to the ability and aptitude of the student, and the best 
              results are attained under instruction and where the attention is 
              regular.<br />

              vowels have been used in shorthand systems from the beginning of 
              the art. The Tironian Notes, which were used in reporting the orations 
              of Cicero, employed joined-vowel signs, as did nearly all the early 
              English systems.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing on this subject, a well-known 
              teacher of shorthand said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No 
                one questions that consonants should be written in the order they 
                are spoken in the word, and it is just as absurd that vowels should 
                be written in as a disconnected afterthought as that they should 
                be so spoken in a discourse or conversation, or that the words 
                of a sentence should be subject to such vagaries.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To an orderly mind one of these 
                departures from the natural order of expression is no more offensive 
                or confusing than the other.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing, like speech, should be 
                simple, direct, orderly, and continuous. If our position here 
                is sound, we are forced to the use of connective vowels as being 
                the only practicable method by which the sounds can be written 
                in a word in the natural order in which they occur or are spoken, 
                thus forming a continuous flow of <em>sound pictures</em>, grouped 
                together in <em>word families</em> in such a way as to show their 
                intimate relationship.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Importance of Vowels. &#8212;</strong> 
              The well-known reporter, Mr. Clyde H. Marshall, in an article on 
              &#8220;The Mastery of Shorthand,&#8221; emphasizes the importance 
              of the vowels in an emphatic way:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
                accented vowel is the most important and suggestive thing about 
                a word. When we give ear to a speaker we hear him by <em>vowels</em>, 
                if I may use that expression. The consonants, for the most part, 
                are not really heard at all. We hear the speaker by his vowels 
                and by his context.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an 
              article in the <em>Shorthand Writer</em>, April, 1919, Mr. Marshall 
              quotes with approval this statement:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align:justify">Explicit expression of the principal&#8212;usually 
                the accented&#8212;vowel sound of a word is of superlative assistance 
                to legibility. But much also depends upon the power to indicate 
                definitely any prominent vowel sound, for again and again this 
                has been found the clue to a tangled mass.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And George 
              R. Bishop, in the introduction to the revised edition of &#8220;Exact 
              Phonography&#8221; (1893), said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 
                needless to say, to one who has made our language a subject of 
                study, that a <em>vowel</em> sound is often the most prominent 
                and distinguishing sound that a word contains; in which case the 
                facile and prominent representing of it becomes especially important.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being 
              the case, the absurdity of writing a consonant skeleton of the word 
              and omitting the sounds which make the most impression on the ear 
              will be clear to anyone.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even more absurd and illogical 
              to be compelled to retain the vowel-sounds in mind and their exact 
              order and position in the word, so that after the consonant outline 
              has been completed they may be expressed by dots and dashes placed 
              in different positions alongside the various consonants of the word.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that in any way justified 
              the adoption of this unnatural method of expressing vowels was the 
              belief that in order to obtain greater brevity than the earlier 
              systems (which represented the vowels by <em>strokes</em> and in 
              some instances by <em>compound strokes</em>) it was necessary to 
              omit the vowels in practical writing.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Correct Theory Triumphs 
              Eventually. &#8212;</strong> It may be admitted at once that the 
              methods by which the vowels were expressed in the earlier joined-vowel 
              systems were extremely clumsy, although some of these systems were 
              practical reporting instruments&#8212;notably the Gurney system, 
              which has been used for reporting the British Parliament for over 
              one hundred years. The <em>principle was right</em>, but the correct 
              application of it had not been discovered. When a principle is right, 
              it is only a question of time when the practical application of 
              it will be evolved, and it was through experience and much experimentation 
              that the solution of the problem of joining vowels and consonants 
              in their natural order without sacrificing speed, was discovered.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time the most familiar 
              and impressive illustration, of how the ingenuity of man, starting 
              with a correct theory, after many disheartening failures, and in 
              the face of almost universal ridicule, achieves the &#8220;impossible,&#8221; 
              is to be found in the aeroplane. But in this series I prefer to 
              take the development of the typewriter as being more closely allied 
              to the art of shorthand. I think, too, that the existing conditions 
              render the comparison more analogous and more interesting.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I well remember the stir caused by 
              the first typewriter with &#8220;visible writing.&#8221; The writing 
              was not so very visible at that, because it was necessary to bend 
              forward and look over a large shield in order to see what had been 
              written. But even that amount of visibility was an advantage, because 
              it obviated the lifting of the carriage to see the writing.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proprietors of the older machines 
              assumed an air of lofty disdain over the new &#8220;fad&#8221; or 
              theory. Said they, &#8220;The really expert operator does not need 
              to look at what he has written&#8221;&#8212;which sounds very much 
              like a paraphrase of &#8220;the really expert shorthand writer does 
              not need to insert vowels very often.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the <em>theory</em> of &#8220;visible 
              writing&#8221; was correct. Soon another machine came along embodying 
              the principle in a more natural and practical way with the slogan 
              &#8220;the writing in plain sight.&#8221; Still the older machines 
              continued to maintain that visible writing was not worthy of consideration. 
              After a long struggle a visible-writing machine won its way to the 
              very front rank.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, touch typewriting 
              had become popular and this furnished the manufacturers of the &#8220;blind-writing&#8221; 
              machines with a new and more plausible argument. They said, &#8220;The 
              touch operator does not need to look at his writing very often; 
              indeed, the difficulty of seeing the writing is an <em>advantage</em>, 
              because it is an incentive to become a touch operator in order to 
              avoid needless lifting of the carriage!&#8221; That sounded very 
              much like the statement quoted in a previous article, that shading 
              was advantageous because it promoted &#8220;discipline of hand movement 
              and concentration&#8221;!<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the visible-writing machines grew 
              in popularity, until the older machines &#8220;scrapped&#8221; their 
              old &#8220;blind-writing&#8221; models and adopted the visible-writing 
              principle&#8212;a decision which meant a revolution of their entire 
              manufacturing and sales organizations at an expenditure of many 
              millions. <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <em>theory</em> of &#8220;visible 
              writing&#8221; was right in the first instance. When a practical 
              method of applying it was evolved, nothing could prevent its universal 
              adoption.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Points of Similarity. &#8212;</strong> 
              It is not necessary to point out the striking analogy that exists 
              in this story of the evolution of &#8220;visible writing&#8221; 
              in typewriters and the evolution of several principles of natural 
              writing in shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the representation 
              of the vowels, it was a long step from the crude and illogical method 
              of expressing vowels, by dots and dashes&#8212;when expressed at 
              all&#8212;to expressing them by joined strokes and dashes. Like 
              the first attempts at &#8220;visible writing&#8221; in typewriters, 
              the expression of such common letters as the vowels by joined strokes 
              and dashes was so clumsy as to be open to serious objection. The 
              principle was right, however, and it is the way of mankind to persist 
              in trying to find a solution of what is apparently insoluble. In 
              the familiar phrase, &#8220;necessity is the mother of invention.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the very natural evolution 
              towards the representation of the vowels by the smallest and most 
              facile signs, circles, hooks, loops, as set forth in an interesting 
              way by Monsieur Martin in a quotation given in this article.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The third step was the assignment 
              of the circles and hooks in accordance with the values of the material 
              and the frequency of the vowels represented by that material.</em><br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A Desideratum Accomplished. 
              &#8212;</strong> In a discussion before the Shorthand Society, London, 
              in 1883, the famous reporter, Thomas Allen Reed&#8212;than whom 
              there never has been a greater authority on Pitman&#8217;s Shorthand, 
              or a more enthusiastic advocate of it&#8212;made this admission:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
                advantage of joined vowels is no doubt very great. If a good system 
                could be constructed in which the vowels and consonants could 
                be all joined continuously, and, at the same time, the system 
                could be as brief as other systems without vowels are, such a 
                system would be a desideratum we should all hail with delight.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 
              perhaps superfluous to say that at the time he made this statement 
              Mr. Reed had no idea that it would be possible to construct such 
              a system! Yet within five years from the time he made the statement 
              such a system was published, and it is to-day written by more people 
              and taught in more than five times the number of schools that are 
              now teaching all forms of disjoined shorthand.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mental Independence Necessary. 
              &#8212;</strong> The truth is that it is difficult for anyone to 
              get away from impressions which have been placed in his mind by 
              constant reading and practice. Habits of thought and action control 
              all of us. Since practically all the literature of shorthand for 
              nearly three-quarters of a century&#8212;that is to say, during 
              all the time shorthand was widely used&#8212;has been written or 
              published by those who are interested in the maintenance of a certain 
              style of shorthand, considerable independence of mind is required 
              to emancipate one&#8217;s self from the impressions thus produced.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One result of the practical monopoly 
              by the Pitman firm of the avenues of publicity in connection with 
              shorthand has been that scant justice has been done to the great 
              work for the advancement of the art which was accomplished by the 
              authors of the early English systems&#8212;Taylor, Mayor, Gurney, 
              Byrom, Stackhouse, Blanchard, and others. The references made to 
              these systems have created an impression that they were utterly 
              unworthy of serious consideration, and that really <em>practical</em> 
              shorthand began with the advent of &#8220;Phonography.&#8221; This 
              is true also of the tone adopted toward French, German, and American 
              systems. Towards all of them the references in Pitman&#8217;s publications 
              are contemptuous. In the first public explanation of &#8220;Light-Line 
              Phonography&#8221; before the Liverpool Shorthand Writers&#8217; 
              Association, an organization consisting exclusively of Isaac Pitman 
              writers, in February, 1893, I said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
                half a century clever Phonographers all over the world have been 
                endeavoring to improve the Pitman method, and their efforts have 
                resulted merely in certain modifications of the superstructure 
                of that system. It is utterly impossible, ladies and gentlemen, 
                to make any vital change in the foundation of the Pitman method. 
                Had it been possible to make any material advance on the old lines, 
                it would have been made long ago by Messrs. Graham, Munson, Longley, 
                or some of the other American adapters of the Pitman system. I 
                might say, incidentally, that I am far from sharing that contempt 
                which is so commonly expressed concerning Graham and Munson, and 
                I think that the writers who abuse our American friends in such 
                unmeasured terms would find much to marvel at if they only studied 
                the works of these talented American writers.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view 
              of all this it has puzzled some thoughtful people to understand 
              why the Gurney system, in which the vowels are represented by joined 
              strokes&#8212;a very clumsy method of representation&#8212;should 
              have been used for the official reporting of committees in Parliament 
              for over one hundred years. Lord George Hamilton once declared that 
              the reporting of the committees in Parliament was performed with 
              &#8216;&#8216;almost mechanical accuracy.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Evolution of Joined Vowels. 
              &#8212;</strong> The evolution of joined-vowel representation toward 
              a natural and facile plan is one of the most interesting things 
              in shorthand history. In a previous article some extracts were given 
              from a letter written to me soon after the publication of &#8220;Light-Line 
              Phonography&#8221; by the distinguished French shorthand author 
              and scientist, M. Jean P. A. Martin, of Lyons. It will be remembered 
              that Monsieur Martin commented on the radical departure from all 
              previous theories of shorthand construction which I had made in 
              giving the preference to curves over straight lines, and that he 
              described &#8220;Light-Line&#8221; as being &#8220;mainly constructed 
              after the principles laid down by Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an, 
              the real founder of continental shorthand.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I did not know anything about Conen 
              de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an at that time, I asked Monsieur Martin who 
              he was and what were the &#8220;principles laid down&#8221; by him. 
              Monsieur Martin&#8217;s answer to my query is so interesting that 
              I am going to quote it somewhat fully. In doing so, however, I must 
              caution the reader not to accept unreservedly his statement that 
              the plan of expressing the vowels by circles and hooks originated 
              with Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an. His very natural enthusiasm 
              for the achievements of a compatriot inclined my gifted correspondent 
              to give Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an more credit than was actually 
              due him.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much as I dislike, at this time especially, 
              to deprive a French author of the glory of originating this method 
              of expressing the vowels, simple justice to earlier English authors 
              compels me to say that circles and hooks were used to express vowels 
              before Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an&#8217;s time. Stackhouse, 
              in 1760, used circles to express vowels&#8212;a small circle for 
              <em>a</em> and a large circle for <em>o, which is the very use made 
              of them by Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an, Aim&eacute;-Paris, Emile 
              Duploy&eacute; and nearly all the other French authors of joined-vowel 
              systems since that time.</em><br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method of using the small circle 
              and the large circle has been adopted by several English and American 
              systems. Blanchard, in 1786, used the small circle for a and <em>o</em>, 
              and a large circle for <em>w</em>. Holdsworth and Aldridge, in their 
              &#8220;Natural Shorthand,&#8221; published in 1766, used a small 
              circle for <em>o</em>, a large circle for <em>ow</em>, a small loop 
              for <em>eu</em>, and a large loop for <em>wh</em>. Oxley (1816) 
              used a downward hook for <em>u</em>; and other early English authors 
              made use of hooks for different vowels. Undoubtedly Monsieur Martin 
              was not aware of these facts at the time he wrote me, any more than 
              I was.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>All Honor To France. &#8212;</strong> 
              Credit may be freely and gratefully given Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an, 
              and to Aim&eacute;-Paris, Duploy&eacute;, and the other French authors 
              who followed his lead, for developing the principle of using circles 
              and hooks for vowels, and for demonstrating its superiority to all 
              other methods of vowel representation. It is possible, too, that 
              they made the best use of that material for expressing the vowels 
              in the French language, although I cannot speak on that subject 
              from personal knowledge. When I come to the discussion of the use 
              of the circles and hooks, I intend to show that the authors of adaptations 
              of the French systems to English, and of systems for English which 
              have copied the French vowel method, have all made a very serious 
              mistake in adopting the French arrangement of the vowels.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Noble Work of M. de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an. 
              &#8212;</strong> With these preliminary remarks, I present Monsieur 
              Martin&#8217;s very interesting story of Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conen 
                de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an published several systems, some of which 
                are still in use in the French Parliament; his alphabets were 
                widely different from one another. Well, his systems are nigh 
                forgotten, but his ideas and principles survived this unfortunate 
                scientist who died in misery after a life spent over shorthand 
                researches and experiments. Five of these principles are quoted, 
                page 42 &#8220;Cours de St&eacute;nographie Francaise&#8221; by 
                L. P. Gu&eacute;nin, edited by C. Delegrave, Paris. In fact, Conen 
                de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an is the originator of the connective vowel 
                systems as they now stand. Without Conen, it is very likely that 
                neither Duploy&eacute; nor Sloan, nor you, nor anybody else, chiefly 
                in England <em>where Taylor reigned</em>, could write any efficient 
                system. The principles set forth by Conen look so natural, <em>so 
                simple</em>, so self-evident that no shorthand author, no modern 
                author, I mean, will ever dream, can ever dream of building a 
                connective-vowel system upon other principles; Conen hit the nail 
                on the head; unknowingly, unwittingly, as all others, you and 
                I and all of us have adopted them. You have received them through 
                Sloan, Sloan though Duploy&eacute;, Duploy&eacute; through Aim&eacute;-Paris, 
                Aim&eacute;Paris through Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an. They 
                are no news now, they are common property, everybody applies them 
                among the connective-vowel shorthand authors and pays as little 
                attention to how they came about as a child thinks of the originators 
                or inventors of our Roman alphabet. Yet what a step from ideographic 
                writing to Roman letter writing! What a tremendous advance! One 
                might say, European civilization is the outcome of the 25 or 26 
                letters of the alphabet. The alphabet is the greatest invention, 
                the greatest blessing, and a boy of ten does not see in it anything 
                particular; it is so common. The same thing occurs with Conen 
                de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an&#8217;s principles, the importance of 
                which is not realized nowadays.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an 
                set to work he had before him two systems: Taylor&#8217;s, which 
                ignored vowels entirely, and Coulon de Th&eacute;venot&#8217;s. 
                Coulon de Th&eacute;venot wrote all the vowels; only the syllables 
                were disconnected, each syllable, though very fluent, very linear, 
                even compact was very complicated; no connection could possibly 
                occur among the various syllables; it was a clumsy-looking system. 
                Every modern shorthand writer swears that it is impracticable 
                because it does look so. Yet as it was in some respects founded 
                on science (fluent, linear, compact enough), it is a well-known 
                fact that very efficient verbatim stenographers used it with great 
                success in spite of its bad looks: Coulon de Th&eacute;venot looks 
                a tremendously huge thing. The point, then, was to make each syllable 
                very short, and at the same time find out a way to retain the 
                vowels and connect each element of the word. Taylor&#8217;s system 
                was there; what signs on earth could be added to his alphabet? 
                He had given the problem up himself by dropping the vowels altogether. 
                Other people took to dots and accents; but that was cutting the 
                Gordian knot instead of untying it. The vowels were a perfect 
                puzzle. Of course, in older systems they were used, but the vowel 
                was a complication. Gurney, for instance, has the following connective 
                signs for his vowels:<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Here Monsieur Martin gave some 
                of the illustrations of the compound signs used by Gurney.]<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syllables were not short! and connecting 
                was occasionally a very tough matter with the old alphabet that 
                had kept special strokes for the vowels.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bertin-Taylor&#8217;s disciples 
                could show very brief outlines, and Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an 
                did not wish to double these in length to add the vowels. <em>That 
                was a very hard nut to crack</em>.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Conen said: Let the vowel signs 
                be <em>four times shorter</em> than consonantal ones; that&#8217;ll 
                make a difference. Then let us take circles or loops, fractions 
                of a small circle, and ticks as vowel signs. Yes; but Taylor&#8217;s 
                consonantal signs were <em>not</em> single strokes; some of them 
                consisted of a hook or a circle and a stroke to represent one 
                letter only; the new loops and fractions of a circle would clash 
                with the hooks of the consonantal signs. <em>That was another 
                puzzle</em>. Shorthand materials were limited in number.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, supposing that there should 
                be no clashing between the loops and hooks, the parts and parcels 
                of the consonantal signs and the vowel signs themselves, the outlines 
                would at any rate be long enough. What should he do?<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Conen said: In order to represent 
                each consonant by a simple sign, let us classify consonants phonetically 
                and if <em>p</em> is short let it be the rule that the corresponding 
                consonant <em>b</em> should be written long. So the problem of 
                one sign for each sound was solved.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the problem of devising connective-vowel 
                systems of shorthand was solved, in giving the vowels a form and 
                ssze corresponding to their importance when compared to the consonants.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not related here all we owe 
                to Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an; but if you have had patience 
                enough to follow my explanation, you cannot help remarking that 
                the principles of that man seem now so self-evident that nobody 
                thinks of them; yet a hundred years ago Gurney, in supplying vowel 
                signs, could not find his way out of bee otherwise than by an 
                awkward combination of strokes for both vowels and consonants. 
                In those days nobody, except Taylor, had yet found a way to use 
                decent connective signs; Taylor was radical: he did not mention 
                them, that&#8217;s all; some did the same, I believe, before him. 
                Pitman is but a disciple and modifier of Taylor.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this Conen was plagiarized 
                extensively, went on working for all his life, spent a fortune, 
                died a destitute and unhappy man, and is now forgotten. He is 
                a true martyr of Shorthand. Whenever I see a new connective-vowel 
                system I think of the poor fellow. What a sad thing!<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excuse haste, bad writing; I am 
                half asleep as it is near three o&#8217;clock and the morn is 
                near, but I wanted to answer the letter of a brother in shorthand 
                pursuits.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Our 
              Early Acknowledgment. &#8212;</strong> When I received this letter 
              from Monsieur Martin in 1888 I was preparing a pamphlet entitled 
              &#8220;Shorthand for the Million,&#8221; and I took advantage of 
              the opportunity to make this acknowledgment to Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circles, 
                hooks, and loops have been adopted as the material suitable for 
                the representation of the vowels. This principle was first laid 
                down by M. Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an, and has been adopted 
                by nearly all the authors of modern connective-vowel systems as 
                the most natural and effective method. It is only in the assignment 
                of this material that most connective-vowel schemes differ, and 
                experience proves that in this respect &#8220;LIGHT-LINE&#8221; 
                has a very decided advantage over all the plans hitherto published. 
                The most facile signs have been carefully assigned to the representation 
                of the most frequently occurring vowels and vice versa, hence 
                there is a far larger percentage of vowels inserted in rapid writing 
                than in any other method.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that 
              time I was not aware that Stackhouse, Blanchard, Oxley, and other 
              English authors had anticipated Conen de Pr&eacute;p&eacute;an to 
              some extent in the use of the circles and hooks for the expression 
              of the vowels.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter has extended to a greater 
              length than I expected; largely on account of the letter from Monsieur 
              Martin, which was so interesting that I could not refrain from quoting 
              it somewhat fully.</p>

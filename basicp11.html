              NINE </strong> </h3>
            <p align="center"><strong>JOINED VOWELS AS SPEED FACTORS</strong></p>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one were to collect 
              even a tithe of all the articles that have been written setting 
              forth the advantages of joined vowels, the result would be a volume 
              of very imposing dimensions. While I was going over much that has 
              been written on the subject for the purpose of finding some of the 
              quotations which have been given in previous chapters, it struck 
              me as remarkable that in all the discussions there was hardly a 
              reference to the gains in <em>brevity</em> or in speed secured by 
              the use of joined vowels.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Joined Vowels Contribute to 
              Brevity. &#8212;</strong> The gains in legibility from the use of 
              joined vowels have been emphasized over and over again, as well 
              as the gains in simplicity through &#8220;writing the sounds in 
              their natural order as they occur.&#8221; These gains are very obvious. 
              But, while the gains in speed from the inclusion of the vowels are 
              not quite so obvious&#8212;especially to those who have not written 
              a joined-vowel system&#8212;they are very real and very important. 
              It is my observation that even many of those who write a joined-vowel 
              system do not appreciate fully the many ways in which joined vowels 
              contribute to brevity of outline.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason I shall try to make 
              clear some of the ways in which joined vowels contribute to brevity 
              of form, beginning with the most obvious one.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Abbreviating Principle. 
              &#8212;</strong> Even writers of disjoined-vowel systems concede 
              that the insertion of vowels permits of an extensive use of a very 
              natural method of abbreviation which can be applied only to an extremely 
              limited extent in. systems in which the vowels are disjoined. In 
              referring to this, Mr. Thomas Anderson, author of &#8220;The History 
              of Shorthand,&#8221; said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural way to abbreviate 
                our words in the spelling is to give the first portion of them 
                accurately; thus, for example, <em>ety</em> is a better abbreviation 
                for <em>etymological</em> than <em>tmlgkl</em>, because it is 
                both rational and sufficient, and so is <em>ery</em> for <em>erysipelas</em>; 
                so with others of kind. The accurate and invariable presence of 
                the vowels is the cardinal merit of Gurney&#8217;s system and 
                has attracted millions to the coffers of that firm, W. B. Gurney 
                &amp; Sons.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the illustrations 
              given by Mr. Anderson do not appeal to us very much, as the words 
              are unusual, his statement of the matter is sound.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher recently wrote us:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following words occur 
                in a book which is now lying open before me: &#8220;In long words 
                only so much need be written as will afford an easy clue.&#8221; 
                You may think this was written by a Gregg writer; but you will 
                be wrong. These words are written with respect to Pitman&#8217;s 
                Shorthand! They occur in &#8220;German Shorthand&#8221; an adaptation 
                of Pitman s Shorthand to the German language. It is the abbreviating 
                principle set forth in as simple language as one could possibly 
                wish for.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the reason why 
              Pitmanic writers do not make greater use of the abbreviating principle 
              is that this valuable and natural method of abbreviating cannot 
              be used advantageously to any great extent in a system in which 
              the vowels are omitted.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Journalist</em> (London) for 
              February 18, 1887, in a review of systems, put it very well:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We confess that at one 
                time joined-vowel systems had no charms for us. &#8230;<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point about joined-vowel 
                systems which is certainly overlooked by the partial critic, and 
                that is the power of abbreviation by using half the word for the 
                whole. When a system which relies wholly on unpronounceable consonants 
                attempts this method, it ignominiously fails. But when, as in 
                the connective-vowel systems, the vowel can be shown where the 
                word is broken off, the plan can be advantageously adopted.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pitmanic systems use 
              the principle where it is possible for them to do so, which is not 
              very often. The greatest of the many &#8220;improvers&#8221; of 
              Pitmanic shorthand, Andrew J. Graham, in his &#8220;Hand-Book of 
              Standard Phonography&#8221; (p. 120), says:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Apocope</em> is the elision of 
              some of the final letters of the word.</p>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As illustrations he gives 
              <em>impos</em>- for <em>impossible</em>, <em>impossibility</em>; 
              <em>prac</em>- for <em>practicable</em>, <em>practicability</em>. 
              (That is carrying the principle much farther than is done in Gregg 
              Shorthand.)<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the next page he says:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An affix-sign, especially 
                when it cannot be conveniently joined, may be omitted by the reporter 
                whenever its omission would not seriously endanger the legibility 
                of his writing; thus, <em>com-ens</em>, <em>commencement</em>; 
                <em>ray-en-jay</em>, <em>arrangement</em>; <em>ned-stend</em>, 
                <em>understanding</em>; <em>iths-gay</em>, <em>thanksgiving</em>; 
                <em>for-gay</em>, <em>forgiving</em>; <em>lev-kind</em>, <em>loving 
                kindness</em>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Oliver McEwan, who 
              was for many years a well-known exponent of Isaac Pitman&#8217;s 
              Shorthand, in an article in the <em>Shorthand and Typewriting News</em>, 
              said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skillful writers are 
                in the habit of contracting lengthy words of frequent occurrence 
                by abbreviating them to the first syllable, or the first two syllables, 
                or to a sufficient number of syllables to clearly indicate what 
                the word intended is.&nbsp; For instance, <em>benevolent</em> 
                is clearly indicated by writing merely the first two syllables&#8212;<em>benev.</em>, 
                <em>dignity</em> is sufficiently represented by means of the letters 
                <em>dig</em>.&nbsp; So the shorthand inventor finds, ready at 
                hand the most convenient means of contracting lengthy words without 
                in any degree sacrificing legibility.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible for two words to 
                have the same outline and still not clash. Words will never clash 
                unless they are of the same part of speech, the same gender, number, 
                and case. You will see, then, that we reduce the possibility of 
                clashing to the smallest possible compass. <em>Dg</em>&#8212; 
                representing <em>dignity</em>, also represents <em>dig</em>, <em>dug</em>, 
                but it will be impossible for any sane shorthand writer to experience 
                difficulty in deciding which of these words is intended by the 
                outline <em>dg&#8212;</em> the context will clearly indicate which 
                word is intended.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j"><br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A Graphic Illustration. &#8212;</strong> 
              In the course of an exposition of our system before a teachers&#8217; 
              association in England Mr. T. S. Halton emphasized the value of 
              the abbreviating principle, and in doing so he made use of a new 
              and excellent illustration. He said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the word <em>rhinoceros</em>. 
                Pitman writes <em>rnsrs</em>, Gregg writes <em>rinos</em>&#8212; 
                diphthong <em>i</em> and the accent on the <em>nos</em>.&nbsp; 
                Now any ordinary person can recognize a rhinoceros by its head 
                and shoulders, but it takes a skilled anatomist to recognize it 
                from its skeleton and dry bones.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot recall a more 
              vivid and convincing way of stating the matter that is contained 
              in this illustration.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abbreviating principle is marvelously 
              simple, marvelously adaptable, and marvelously effective. It is 
              the principle over which Pitmanic writers become most enthusiastic 
              when they master our system. As it is a new thing to them&#8212;and 
              contrary to previous practice in a system based on the idea of expressing 
              consonants and not vowels&#8212;they usually view it with misgivings 
              at first. Perhaps this is why they are so enthusiastic about it 
              later when they find that not only were their misgivings without 
              foundation, but that the principle is so valuable. Writers of the 
              system who have <em>not</em> written a Pitmanic system previously 
              are sometimes puzzled to know why &#8220;converts&#8221; to our 
              system are so enthusiastic about the Abbreviating Principle; to 
              them the application of it is so natural and easy that they give 
              it no more thought than they do to the turning of an electric light 
              switch.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Its &#8220;Exhaustless Power.&#8221; 
              &#8212;</strong> Referring to this timidity about the Abbreviating 
              Principle on the part of those who, like himself, had used Pitmanic 
              shorthand for many years, Mr. Charles M. Miller, of New York, in 
              his address as the first President of the Gregg Shorthand Association 
              of America&#8212;after narrating his experiences in changing from 
              Pitmanic shorthand after having written it professionally for more 
              than twenty years, paid an eloquent tribute to the abbreviating 
              principle. He said: &#8220;I have found the abbreviating principle 
              of the system, and the power that lies behind it, the most fascinating 
              of studies. . . . Now that it is so simple to me, and I know its 
              exhaustless power, I want you to know it as well.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous article we quoted 
              the views of one of the most respected of the London professional 
              reporters, Mr. Thomas Hill, who has written Pitman Shorthand for 
              more than thirty-five years. I repeat one paragraph, as it applies 
              to this subject:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An incidental benefit 
                arising from the use of joined vowels is that it enables the first 
                syllable or two of a long word to be used in many cases with safety 
                to represent the whole word, and puts into the hands of an experienced 
                writer a means of extemporizing contractions without risk of illegibility. 
                The clipping of words after this manner has been in use probably 
                from the earliest days of shorthand, but a system in which connective 
                vowels are used gives the best opportunities for carrying out 
                this method of abbreviation.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the introduction to 
              a series of articles on &#8220;Abbreviations&#8221; in <em>Pitman&#8217;s 
              Journal</em>, Mr. E. A. Cope, in speaking of &#8220;the abbreviating 
              instinct,&#8221; said:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mankind has always been 
                addicted to shortcuts, given to striving to save time and labor. 
                . . .<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took the word &#8220;omnibus&#8221; 
                and reduced it to &#8220;bus.&#8221; It curtailed &#8220;cabriolet&#8221; 
                and left us with the irreducible syllable &#8220;cab.&#8221; It 
                cut down &#8220;tramway-car&#8221; to &#8220;tram,&#8221; and 
                is converting &#8220;perambulator&#8221; into &#8220;pram.&#8221; 
                It refused to tolerate &#8220;taximeter-cab&#8221; and insisted 
                on saying &#8220;taxi.&#8221; Even &#8220;motor-car&#8221; was

                precedents.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This confirms in a very 
              striking way Mr. Anderson&#8217;s statement that this method of 
              abbreviation is the most natural that can be applied.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A Poetical Illustration. 
              &#8212;</strong> The beauty, practicability, and <em>power</em> 
              of the &#8220;abbreviating principle&#8221; is graphically shown 
              in the following poem by Mr. Harry Graham, which appeared in the 
              <em>Century Magazine</em> several years ago, just after President 
              Roosevelt had issued his famous order in regard to spelling reform.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know whether Mr. Graham 
              is a writer of the system or not, but he has assuredly grasped the 
              genius of the abbreviating principle. There is not an abbreviated 
              word in it that is not instantly recognizable. Even with the verse 
              dealing with golf&#8212;which to many is a technical subject&#8212;such 
              words as &#8220;hazard,&#8221; &#8220;niblick,&#8221; &#8220;Haskell,&#8221; 
              and &#8220;bunker&#8221; are unmistakable to any one of ordinary 
              sense.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a principle is possible only 
              in a system like ours where the essential vowels are an unmistakable 
              part of the form. Vowels are what give the life, vividness, and 
              &#8220;voice&#8221; to words, make them speak out truly and clearly. 
              A mere consonant outline is nothing&#8212;&#8221;unspeakable,&#8221; 
              because you can&#8217;t pronounce it. An outline made up of the 
              consonants in a word only is but a skeleton of &#8220;dry bones.&#8221; 
              The vowels add red blood, flesh, and sinew. They make the word a 
              thing of life. And the simplicity of the abbreviating principle 
              is one of its greatest charms. You are not hampered by rules, restricted 
              and confused by exceptions. You simply write the part of the word 
              that is unmistakably suggestive.</p>

            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Disjoined Prefixes 
              and Suffixes. &#8212;</strong> Disjoined-vowel systems, in which 
              dots and dashes are used for vowels, are limited to consonant strokes 
              for the representation of prefixes and suffixes. With the exception 
              of the dot for <em>con</em> these signs are not available in such 
              systems for the expression of prefixes or suffixes&#8212;since the 
              dots and dashes, if used for prefixes, might be read as vowels. 
              (Incidentally as <em>shaded</em> strokes are not good material for 
              prefixes or suffixes, few <em>consonant</em> signs are available 
              for the expression of prefixes or suffixes in shaded, disjoined-vowel 
              systems.)<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In joined-vowel systems the signs 
              for <em>both</em> consonants and vowels may be used for the expression 
              of prefixes and suffixes, thus obtaining great brevity of form for 
              many long words. In Gregg Shorthand, for instance, we use the following 
              vowel-signs for both prefixes and suffixes:</p>
            <table width="80%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="text">
              <tr> 
                <td>(1) a small circle</td>
                <td>(4) a large loop</td>
              </tr>
              <tr> 
                <td>(2) a large circle</td>
                <td>(5) an upward hook</td>
              </tr>
              <tr> 
                <td>(3) a small loop</td>
                <td>(6) a downward hook</td>
              </tr>
              <tr> 
                <td colspan="2"><div align="center">(7) a hook on its side</div></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p class="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the full significance 
              of this, it should be remembered that these signs can be used for 
              both prefixes and suffixes. In addition, we can use combinations 
              of these, joined in their natural order, to form derivatives of 
              <em>both</em> prefixes and suffixes, particularly suffixes.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Joined Prefixes Definitely 
              Indicated. &#8212;</strong> On account of the fact that at the beginning 
              of words certain consonants cannot be pronounced with other consonants 
              without an intervening vowel, many joined prefixes are possible 
              in a joined-vowel system which are not possible in a disjoined vowel 
              system.&nbsp; The fact that there is no vowel between the first 
              and second consonant in a joined-vowel system indicates clearly 
              that the consonant represents a prefix.&nbsp; In Gregg Shorthand, 
              for instance, <em>for</em> and <em>fore</em> are expressed by <em>f</em>.&nbsp; 
              When the writer sees <em>f-most</em> he knows that <em>f</em> is 
              <em>for</em> or <em>fore</em> because <em>fm</em> could not be sounded 
              with a vowel between them, therefore, the word is read as foremost.&nbsp; 
              So, too, with <em>f-noon</em>, for <em>forenoon</em>, and other 
              words in which <em>for</em> or <em>fore</em> occur.&nbsp; To take 
              another illustration: <em>con</em> and <em>com</em> are expressed 
              by <em>k</em>, and the writer on seeing <em>k-ply</em> knows that 
              the form must be <em>comply</em>, because <em>k</em> and <em>p</em> 
              cannot be sounded with a vowel: therefore it must be <em>com</em>; 
              and it cannot be <em>con</em> because <em>con</em> never occurs 
              before <em>p</em> or <em>b</em>.&nbsp; We might go on illustrating 
              this with other joined prefixes.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be done in a disjoined-vowel 
              system because in practice the vowels are omitted.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Joined Suffixes Definitely 
              Indicated. &#8212;</strong> What was said about the absence of a 
              vowel in a joined-vowel system indicating a joined prefix applies 
              equally well to joined suffixes. When a writer sees <em>breth-l</em> 
              (<em>breathless</em>) he knows that the <em>l</em> stands for <em>less</em>, 
              because otherwise there would be a vowel-sign between the <em>th</em> 
              and the <em>l</em>; <em>bash-f</em> must be <em>bashful</em> for 
              the same reason, <em>achev-m</em> must be <em>achievement</em>, 
              and so on with the other suffixes.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be done in a disjoined-vowel 
              system because the vowels are omitted in practice.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Vowel Indication. &#8212;</strong> 
              Someone has remarked in a semi-humorous vein that one of the advantages 
              of joined vowels is that their omission indicates them!&nbsp; Paradoxical 
              as it may seem, the statement is true, when applied under definite 
              rules in a joined-vowel system.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the rule in Gregg 
              Shorthand for the omission of u and ow before n and m. The outline 
              <em>r-nd</em> could not be anything but <em>rund</em> or <em>round</em>. 
              The writer knows that in that combination <em>r</em> and <em>n</em> 
              cannot be sounded without an intervening vowel; and he knows, too, 
              that if it were <em>rind</em>, <em>rend</em>, <em>rand</em>, <em>rond</em>, 
              <em>ruined</em>, the vowel would appear in the outline; therefore, 
              the form must either be <em>rund</em> or <em>round</em>&#8212;and 
              there is no such word as <em>rund</em>. If the form is <em>gr-nd</em>, 
              he knows it must be <em>ground</em>, because the vowel would be 
              written in <em>grand</em>, <em>grinned</em>, <em>groaned</em>, <em>grind</em>. 
              Many other illustrations could be given.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Wordsigns Made Distinctive.&#8212;</strong> 
              The wordsigns, &#8220;grammalogues&#8221; and &#8220;logograms&#8221; 
              of the disjoined-vowel systems are very unreliable because there 
              is no expression to them on account of the omission of the vowels.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wordsign or &#8220;grammalogue&#8221; 
              consisting of one or two consonants may stand not only for the particular 
              contraction given in the list, but also for many other words in 
              which vowels are omitted in rapid writing.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &#8220;logograms&#8221; are mere 
              dots and dashes dependent upon shading and upon their position&#8212;purely 
              arbitrary contractions that must be memorized.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is eliminated in a joined-vowel 
              system. The insertion of a vowel&#8212;the addition of a facile 
              circle or hook requiring hardly any effort&#8212;not only clearly 
              distinguishes the word forms but gives <em>sound</em>&#8212;life&#8212;to 
              the word, which enables the student to <em>learn</em> the particular 
              form without any trouble.&nbsp; As illustrations: <em>ab</em> for 
              <em>about</em>, <em>af</em> for <em>after</em>, <em>bo</em> for 
              <em>body</em>, <em>col</em> for <em>collect</em>, <em>cre</em> for 
              <em>credit</em>, <em>edu</em> for <em>educate</em>, <em>ev</em> 
              for <em>every</em>, <em>fa</em> for <em>far</em>, <em>fi</em> for 
              <em>find</em>, <em>fo</em> for <em>follow</em>, <em>fu</em> for 
              <em>full</em>, <em>gi</em> for <em>give</em>, <em>ime</em> for <em>immediate</em>, 
              <em>loo</em> for <em>look</em>, <em>mo</em> for <em>most</em>, <em>na</em> 
              for <em>name</em>, <em>rep</em> for <em>reply</em>, <em>res</em> 
              for <em>respect</em>, <em>ri</em> for <em>right</em>, <em>si</em> 
              for <em>side</em>, <em>shu</em> for <em>sure</em>, <em>tha</em> 
              for <em>that</em>, <em>to</em> for <em>told</em>, <em>ve</em> for 
              <em>very</em>.&nbsp; The ease with which such abbreviations can 
              be learned is obvious, and it is also obvious that they are distinctive.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr. Peter Vogel said, &#8220;The 
              number of possible outlines can be greatly multiplied by the use 
              or absence of a vowel, and so relieve consonant outlines from congestion 
              and make them more definite.&#8221;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Phrase-writing Power Increased. 
              &#8212;</strong> The phrase-forms in a joined-vowel system are much 
              more distinctive than in a disjoined-vowel system. In a disjoined-vowel 
              system many word-forms and phrases look alike because in <em>both</em> 
              word-forms and phrase-forms the vowels are omitted; therefore, the 
              need of distinguishing between word and phrase-forms limits the 
              extent to which phrase-writing may be used. In a joined-vowel system 
              the absence of vowels in most cases indicates that the form is a 
              phrase.&nbsp; For example, when a writer of Gregg Shorthand sees 
              <em>f-t-l-b</em>&#8212;all &#8220;unpronounceable consonants&#8221;&#8212;he 
              knows that it is the phrase, <em>for it will be</em>; it cannot 
              possibly be a word.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the insertion of the vowels 
              opens a field of abbreviation in the modification of word-forms 
              for words that occur in many common phrases; thus<em> k</em> may 
              be used for <em>week</em> because <em>this-k</em>, <em>last-k</em>, 
              <em>past-k</em>, <em>next-k</em> are all absolutely clear.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Consistency and Simplicity 
              in Word-Building and in Forming Derivatives. &#8212;</strong> One 
              very great gain from the insertion of the vowels is the natural 
              and logical manner in which derivatives are formed. The necessity 
              for distinguishing word-forms consisting of mere consonants compels 
              disjoined-vowel systems to depart from logical word-building principles 
              in forming derivatives of many words. This is not necessary in joined-vowel 
              systems. Simplicity of mental effort in word-building contributes 
              enormously to speed.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Elimination of Long Lists 
              of &#8220;Words Distinguished.&#8221; &#8212;</strong> All disjoined-vowel 
              systems contain long lists of &#8220;distinguished outlines,&#8221; 
              words with the same consonants but different vowels, in which it 
              is necessary to distinguish in some arbitrary way: by a change in 
              the form of the word; by &#8220;position&#8221;; or by the insertion 
              of a vowel.&nbsp; The memorizing of these lists is admittedly one 
              of the hardest tasks that confronts the student-and the lists must 
              be mastered or &#8220;clashes&#8221; of a serious nature will result 
              in transcribing.&nbsp; The Isaac Pitman &#8220;Centenary Instructor&#8221; 
              contains no less than fifteen closely-printed pages of such outlines 
              and the list is not complete!&nbsp; To take a few examples at random:<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Str</em> expresses <em>satire</em>, 
              <em>star</em>, <em>stare</em>, <em>steer</em>, <em>starry</em>, 
              <em>story</em>, <em>stray</em>, <em>Austria</em>, <em>astray</em>, 
              <em>astir</em>, <em>austere</em>, <em>estuary</em>, <em>oyster</em>, 
              and<em> Easter</em>.&nbsp; In order to distinguish the forms for 
              each of these words different forms for <em>s</em>, for <em>str</em>, 
              for <em>r</em> are called into use; there is no consistency, no 
              logical word-building principle.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Prprt</em> represents <em>appropriate</em>, 
              <em>property</em>, <em>propriety</em>, <em>purport</em>;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Prch</em> represents <em>approach</em>, 
              <em>preach</em>, <em>parch</em>, <em>porch</em>, <em>perch</em>;<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dtr</em> represents <em>daughter</em>, 
              <em>auditor</em>, <em>debtor</em>, <em>doubter</em>, <em>editor</em>, 
              <em>dietary</em>, <em>auditory</em>, <em>deter</em>, <em>detour</em>.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so on almost <em>ad infinitum</em>.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few words in a joined-vowel 
              system that need to be distinguished by special forms&#8212;the 
              insertion of the vowels provide the distinction in almost every 
              case.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapidity in shorthand writing depends 
              upon the promptness with which the correct form is conceived or 
              recalled by the brain.&nbsp; It is very obvious that if the student 
              has to memorize long lists of words that must be distinguished arbitrarily&#8212;many 
              of such words being written for that purpose <em>contrary to rule</em>&#8212;there 
              will be hesitancy in recalling them.&nbsp; When the mind is relieved 
              of that burden, through joined vowels, there is an enormous gain 
              in the promptness with which the forms are recalled and written.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in this is to be found 
              the chief reason why so many young writers of Gregg Shorthand, in 
              the speed contests conducted by the National Shorthand Reporters&#8217; 
              Association have surpassed the records made by experienced Pitmanic 
              reporters of more than double their age and experience&#8212;records 
              that have never been made, or even approached, by Pitmanic writers 
              of their age or experience.</p>
